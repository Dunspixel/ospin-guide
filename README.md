# How To Rotate Your O-Piece
Live Website: https://dunspixel.github.io/ospin-guide

"To a casual Tetris player, rotating the O-piece appears to be completely useless. It's the only piece which does not move when you rotate it, and its identical rotation states typically prevent it from interacting with walls or other pieces. But what if there were actually ways to use these seemingly useless rotations to your advantage? As it turns out, many Tetris games and stackers based on the series do actually implement game mechanics which make it useful to rotate the O-piece."

This is a work-in-progress guide about everything to do with O-piece rotations and O-Spins. When finished, it will cover the entire Tetris series and the majority of Tetris-like stacker games which have unique applications for O-piece rotations.
