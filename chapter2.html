				<h3>How To Rotate Your O-Piece</h3>
				<h2>Chapter 2: Guideline Tetris</h2>

                <p>
                    The Tetris Guideline is a document which developers of Tetris games follow to ensure each game has some degree of
					mechanical consistency. Tetris Worlds from 2001 established most of the mechanics that would form the Tetris Guideline
					as it is known today, with subsequent games building on and refining it. Almost every Tetris game released since then
					has adhered to some version of this guideline, hence why modern Tetris games are often referred to as "Guideline
					Tetris".
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most important feature of the Tetris Guideline is the aforementioned <span class="system">SRS</span>, which it
					introduced to the Tetris series. We'll encounter a lot of rotation systems in this guide, but <span class="system">SRS
					</span> is by far the one you'll see the most both in modern Tetris games and in Tetris-like stackers.

					<h3>Move-Reset Lock Delay</h3>
	
					<p>
						Finally! I get to talk about an actual use for O-piece rotations! This one is by far the most practical O-piece
						rotation technique you can use in the Tetris series at any skill level. If you only learn one thing from this
						guide, let it be this.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Many Tetris games, including all guideline games, implement a lock delay. This means when the active piece reaches
						the bottom of the board or the top of the stack, the game provides a brief window of time (typically 30 frames or
						half a second) to move or rotate the piece before it locks into place.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						<strong>Move-Reset Lock Delay</strong>, as implemented in most guideline Tetris games, resets whenever the active
						piece is moved or rotated. Earlier guideline games such as Tetris Worlds and Tetris DS allow you to do this
						indefinitely, while later games impose a limit of 15 resets per step. This means once your active piece reaches a
						floor, it can be moved or rotated up to 15 times before it is forced to lock, with these 15 resets replenishing
						when the piece moves down due to gravity or soft drop. A staircase-like formation can be used to maximise the
						number of resets you can do with a single piece.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						For games without a reset limit, this mechanic is also known as <strong>Infinity</strong>.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Repeatedly resetting the lock delay just before the piece locks is called <strong>stalling</strong>. This is a
						versatile technique which is useful at a variety of skill levels, especially in multiplayer battles. Some examples
						include:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>
							Giving yourself extra time to decide where to place a piece
						</li>
						<li>
							Delaying a line clear in battle to block or mitigate an incoming attack that would cause you to top out
						</li>
						<li>
							Delaying a <span class="tooltip" title="piecement places">piece placement</span> to receive garbage lines from
							an imminent attack, then using this garbage for a counterspike
						</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						If your active piece is an O-piece, then all of this can be achieved by rotating it while it's on the floor. In
						tight areas, many pieces can wall kick to unexpected places when rotated, especially if you're less familiar with
						<span class="system">SRS</span>. Because the O-piece does not move on rotation in guideline Tetris games, it is the
						easiest and safest piece to use when stalling.

				<section id="effect-irs">
					<h3>Tetris Effect and Initial Rotation</h3>
	
					<p>
						Tetris Effect features two major mechanics which make O-piece rotations especially useful when used together:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>
							The Zone, which stops time and allows you to perform massive line clears
						</li>
						<li>
							Initial Rotation System (<strong>IRS</strong>), which allows you to spawn pieces in a pre-rotated state
						</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						Tetris Effect is not the first game to include IRS - that would be Tetris The Grand Master. However, I find myself
						considering my active piece when buffering IRS to be most useful in the Zone, hence why I have written the section
						like this. Either way, it's worth noting that you <em>can</em> use an O-piece to buffer IRS in the TGM games, but
						doing so isn't quite as useful or necessary.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Also note that IRS is a setting in the options menu that is turned off by default. You will need to set it to
						Type-A for it to be able to prevent top-outs in tight spaces.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						In Tetris Effect, all pieces spawn with their lowest block on row 20. When your stack is at the top of your board,
						you have limited space to spawn and manoeuvre pieces without topping out. To prevent topping out, hold a rotation
						button on your active piece while placing it, which will activate IRS and spawn the next piece rotated in that
						direction. This will cause the spawned piece to span fewer columns and is particularly useful for two types of
						situation:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>Surviving poor board states and/or a large number of garbage lines, allowing you to downstack</li>
						<li>Using Zone to clear 20 <span class="tooltip" title="kirb your ultimatris">or more</span> lines at once</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						With most pieces, if your active piece is already in the desired rotation state and you are not already holding the
						appropriate rotation button, it's usually easiest to initialise the next piece's spawn state with a pair of
						back-and-forth rotations. For example, if you want to spawn your next piece in state <span class="state">R</span>,
						you would quickly perform a counter-clockwise rotation, then a clockwise rotation, then lock the piece while still
						holding that clockwise rotation. It's not strictly necessary to do this, but with such a tight window after locking
						your piece this technique is much more consistent than relying on piece entry delay.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Because the O-piece has identical rotation states, you do not need to consider its current rotation state when
						placing it. Even if you are not currently holding a rotation button, you only need to perform a single rotation in
						the direction of the next piece's desired spawn state, which makes the O-piece the easiest piece to use when
						buffering IRS with such a short piece entry delay.

					<h3>Puyo Puyo Tetris and Stack Overlap "O-Spins"</h3>
	
					<p>
						This is much more whimsical than the other uses in this chapter, having pretty much zero practical use. However
						seeing an O-piece wall kick in a modern guideline Tetris game and the ridiculous setup it requires is absolutely
						hilarious and I love it.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Puyo Puyo Tetris implements a slightly altered <span class="system">SRS</span> offset table which defines wall
						kicks for the O-piece. This is because of the P pentomino used in the game's Party mode, which the O-piece derives
						an offset table from.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Triggering this wall kick for the standard O-piece is much trickier, and requires you to exploit situations where
						your active piece overlaps with your stack without topping you out. There are two ways of doing this:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>
							Take an O-piece out of hold in a situation where it would overlap with your stack - this won't top you out
							until the piece locks due to a PPT-specific bug
						</li>
						<li>
							In Fusion mode, use an O-piece to slowly break through a stack of Puyos into a double line clear and place
							another O-piece underneath a part of your stack before the line clear moves your stack into your O-piece
						</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						<span class="todo">TODO: Lab Hold glitch and describe O-Spin setups</span>
					</p>
						
					<p>
						Fusion mode combines Puyo Puyo with Tetris on the same board, introducing some unusual behaviour when Puyos and
						Tetris pieces interact with each other. By soft dropping a piece on top of a Puyo stack, the Tetris piece will
						slowly break through the stack, and activate the next piece which you can use at the same time.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						There is a complex setup in Fusion mode which allows you to exploit this behaviour and execute an O-spin:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>A Tetris stack with a two wide, minimum four high well</li>
						<li>Puyos filling the well in this stack</li>
						<li>An overhang above the well, with enough space to the side and underneath to fit an O-piece</li>
						<li>A fully enclosed O-shaped hole inside this overhang, with the floor being one block high</li>
						<li>Access to two consecutive O-pieces via the next and/or hold queues</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						First, slide the first O-piece under the overhang and allow it to lock on top of the puyo stack. Once it locks, it
						will slowly break through the puyo stack.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						When the second O-piece spawns (or you take it out of hold), perform a <span class="state">0R&gt;</span> rotation.
						You can then use the time spent by the first piece breaking through the puyo stack to move the second O-piece to
						the same place. You'll want to time it so the first piece reaches the bottom and clears the lines before the second
						piece is affected by gravity.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						When the lines are cleared, your second O-piece will be pushed into the ceiling (or the floor of the hole). When
						this happens, perform an <span class="state">&lt;R0</span> rotation and your O-piece will kick upwards, filling the
						hole and completing the O-Spin.

					<h3>Tetris Stardust and Actual O-Spins</h3>
	
					<p>
						Ok, maybe you're thinking that last section was a bit too silly. Perhaps you're looking for an O-Spin in a
						guideline Tetris game that is developer intended and doesn't require a ludicrous setup. You're probably also
						wondering if such a game really exists in the Tetris series. Good news, it does, and it's called Tetris Stardust!
					</p>
	
					<p>
						To tell you the truth, I only recently learned this game existed, mainly because it's a game that was only released
						in Japan, made using Silverlight of all things, and there was very little information about it online before I
						wrote this guide. It's mostly based on Tetris Online, but with a few important differences. As you can probably
						tell by the existence of this section, some of these differences have something to do with how the O-piece behaves.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Tetris Stardust primarily uses <span class="system">SRS</span> just like any other guideline Tetris game, but there
						is a special case which allows the O-piece to wall kick. Unusually for a game with O-piece kicks, the O-piece
						doesn't actually move on normal rotation, nor does it have multiple distinct rotation states (though it does
						technically have four identical states). Instead, it checks the following conditions and bypasses basic rotation if
						the check succeeds:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>If rotating left, the space directly underneath the <strong>lower-right</strong> block must be occupied.</li>
						<li>If rotating right, the space directly underneath the <strong>lower-left</strong> block must be occupied.</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						If the check succeeds, the O-piece will then kick according to the offset chart below. To my knowledge, Tetris
						Stardust is the only Tetris game which actually acknowledges O-Spins by name, and also the only one to explicitly
						reward them. An interesting side effect of this mechanic is that rotation can now fail, thus causing it to replace
						most of the stalling utility present in other Guideline games. However, this is a worthwhile trade-off as there is
						no VS mode and gravity is permanently at level 1.
					</p>
	
					<div class="centre">
						<img src="img/stardust_opiece_offset.png" alt="Tetris Stardust O-Piece Offset Chart" />
					</div>
	
					<p>
						This is about all I could figure out just by playing the game, considering how little it was documented at the
						time. So I did what any curious and totally sane person would do in this situation, and ran the game through a
						decompiler. Fortunately, Silverlight apps are very easy to decompile, and it means I got to do some
						<span class="tooltip" title="Can you tell this is the section I had the most fun writing?">original research</span>
						for once!
					</p>
	
					<p>
						In addition to the points scored by O-Spins and their associated line clears, the act of performing these spins
						awards points based on a "Spin Rank" system unique to this game. There are a total of 10 Spin Ranks: E, D, C, B,
						A-, A, A+, S-, S, and S+. Any kick that would cause the Spin Rank to exceed S+ will simply award an S+.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Spin Rank is particularly useful because it awards points without clearing lines, and the aim of Tetris Stardust is
						to score as many points as possible in 40 lines.
					</p>
						
					<p>
						Spin Rank is awarded for each kick that moves the piece below its previous lowest block. This means upward and
						purely horizontal kicks will not award Spin Rank. This also prevents you from gaining Spin Rank by repeatedly
						performing a kick, then the opposite kick to move it back to its previous position. Score for Spin Rank is awarded
						per wall kick, so performing multiple rank-eligible kicks with the same piece will award multiple score bonuses.
						For example, a C-Rank spin (200 points) followed by a B-Rank spin (400 points) performed with the same piece will
						award a total of 600 points, not just the 400 for the final spin.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						The Spin Rank of a particular kick is determined by comparing the position of a piece to its surroundings. The code
						in this area is very complicated, but I think the idea behind them is that particular configurations require a
						certain kick to have taken place, so this can be used to award higher ranks for stronger spins.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Configurations consist of a list of block positions relative to the active piece's new rotation state. The internal
						position of the O-piece is considered to be the top-left of a 4x4 area in which the O-piece is at the centre. For
						each configuration, if all of its listed positions are occupied, then that Spin Rank check will succeed, awarding a
						Spin Rank equal to the base rank of the configuration, plus some bonuses for later wall kicks and chained spins.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Below is a full list of configurations checked for the O-piece in the order they are checked, with the base ranks
						listed below. While the game does technically define this for each rotation state, the four lists for the O-piece
						are identical, even including the seemingly erroneous final configuration.

						~<span class="tooltip" title="I suspect this one is a typo - from the other configurations it looks like it should

					</div>
	
					<p>
						There's a much simpler way of describing this, though, so don't worry about memorising all of these configurations.
						Also, configurations 9, 10, 17, and 18 are inaccessible following a wall kick. Here's an overview of how Spin Rank
						is affected by the performed wall kick:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>
							Basic rotation and Kick 1 do not award Spin Rank. This is applicable to all pieces and would be true even if
							Kick 1 moved the O-piece downwards.
						</li>
						<li>
							Kick 2 awards a configuration's base Spin Rank. For the O-piece, this will always result in a C rank
							configuration.
						</li>
						<li>
							Kicks 3 and 4 award a configuration's base Spin Rank plus 2. This will usually result in a B rank configuration
							which gets promoted to A rank, with one exception: if Kick 4 is performed without the opposite upper corner
							being occupied (see configurations 2 and 5 above) or the block below it (configurations 3 and 6), it will not
							satisfy any of the B rank checks and instead award a Spin Rank of A- (two higher than C rank).
						</li>
						<li>
							Interestingly, the rank+2 case also applies to Kick 5, even though such a kick does not exist. Looking at some
							of those configurations, I wonder if the O-piece was originally intended to have additional kicks that move
							upwards?
						</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						I don't believe this is possible for the O-piece, but if none of a state's configuration checks succeed after a
						kick, the default Spin Rank of -1 (no rank) is awarded. This can be increased by kick bonuses and spin chains, and
						is the only way to get Spin Rank D. As far as I can tell, Spin Rank E is not actually obtainable.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Spin Rank can also be increased by chaining multiple kicks together. The amount depends on the Spin Rank of the
						previous kick:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>E, D, C: +1</li>
						<li>B, A-: +2</li>
						<li>A, A+, S-: +3</li>
						<li>S, S+: +4</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						It's also worth noting that for non-T pieces, a spin is considered "mini" if its Spin Rank is B or lower. This
						means the second O kick will usually be a mini spin, while kicks 3 and 4 register as full spins.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Below are some examples of chained spins and the ranks they award. All of these setups can be mirrored, though you
						will always need to rotate in the direction of movement.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						In this first example, the first C-Rank spin adds a +1 bonus to the second C-Rank spin, which promotes it to a
						B-Rank spin. This scores a total of 600 Spin Rank points.

						A-Rank spins add a +3 bonus to following spins, so chaining two of them together promotes the second spin to

						third increases the total to 4200.

					<h3>Useful Notes</h3>
	
					<p>
						Some Guideline-era games actually implement <strong>Step-Reset Lock Delay</strong> instead of move-reset. This
						means the lock delay only resets when your active piece moves downwards due to gravity or soft-drop, much like how
						move-reset's reset count works. This prevents you from stalling by rotating a piece while it is on the floor and
						typically removes all utility for O-piece rotations.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						These games include:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>
							Tetris The Grand Master 3 (Classic Rule)
							<ul>
								<li>
									World Rule uses move-reset lock delay, meaning O-piece rotations can be used to stall like in most
									Guideline games.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Tetris Giant/Dekaris
							<ul>
								<li>
									To my knowledge, there is no use for rotating the O-piece in this particular game. I still love it,
									though.
