				<h3>How To Rotate Your O-Piece</h3>
				<h2>Chapter 5: Closing Thoughts</h2>

                <p>
                    With that, I hope I was able to teach you how O-piece rotations can be useful or otherwise fun, and that I have helped
					you learn to love them for what they can do. The stacker genre is far more complex than most players give it credit for
					and I love to see even the most obscure minutiae about these games being shared.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Working on this project actually got me into researching Tetris games and their mechanics. Even though I had only set
					out to learn everything I can about O-piece rotations, I found myself learning about games I didn't know existed, and
					finding out previously undocumented information about a variety of Tetris games, related to this guide or otherwise. In
					some cases, I even tried some reverse engineering to see how these games actually work, with varying degrees of
					success. I look forward to seeing how much deeper this rabbit hole is in the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you to everyone whose work I have linked in this guide! Every guide and demonstration from the Tetris community
					and the communities of each stacker game has been incredibly useful to me, and every stacker game featured in Chapter 4
					has provided many hours of enjoyment and wonder.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd also like to thank everyone who has taken the time to read my guide, and especially those of you who have helped me
					improve it! If you love to rotate the O-piece, you should know that you're really cool!
                </p>

					<h3>Feedback</h3>
	
					<p>
						I welcome feedback and constructive criticism, as I'd like to make this guide as comprehensive and accurate as
						possible. In particular, I'm interested to know:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>
							Do you know of any stackers I can add a section for?
						</li>
						<li>
							Do you know of any additional links (sources, resources, tools, or showcases) I can add to any of the sections?
						</li>
						<li>
							Have I miscredited any of the included sources?
						</li>
						<li>
							Are there any factual errors that need correcting?
						</li>
						<li>
							Are there more mechanics and techniques I can add to existing sections?
						</li>
						<li>
							Is there anything I can explain better?
						</li>
						<li>
							Are you experiencing any technical issues on this page?

					<h3>Unsolved Problems</h3>
	
					<p>
						In some sections, I presented questions I don't know the answer to. I figured it would be a good idea to put them
						all in one place here:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>
							Can S/Z and J/L/T be distinguished while blindfolded in NES Tetris?
						</li>
						<li>
							Can performing an O-Spin Double in TETR.IO's Zenith Tower revive your partner if the last remaining revive
							condition is to clear a Double with an O-piece? If this kills you, is it registered before your partner is
							revived?
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						If you'd like to discuss this guide with me, you can message me on Discord (my username is "dunspixel",
						unsurprisingly). Alternatively, you can add me in one of the above stackers (if it has a friend/message feature)
						and message me there. I'm generally most active in TETR.IO out of those.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						I'd be happy to talk about O-piece rotations, O-Spins, and wacky Tetris mechanics in general. However, please be
						aware that I'm very shy and socially awkward. I'll do my best to be nice.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						For technical and/or factual problems, please raise an issue on the GitHub repo. There's a link to the repo at the
						bottom of the page.

					<h3>Random Ramblings</h3>
	
					<p>
						This isn't really part of the guide, but I like rambling. Maybe you'll find some of it interesting.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Tetris Effect is not a rhythm game. Rather, you are a rhythm game which Tetris Effect plays perfectly. Tetris
						Effect has exactly one rhythm-based game mechanic and it requires you to be dead in Connected mode to utilise it.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						"Tetris Attack" is not a Tetris game. It's not even a stacker game. It's a Panel de Pon game that was renamed for
						marketing purposes. I <em>will</em> refer to this game as <span class="tooltip"
						title="It should have been released in English as 'Yoshi's Puzzle League'">Yoshi no Panepon</span> and you cannot
						convince me to do otherwise. With that said, I do think it's a really good game.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						On the topic of match-3 games, I grew up during a time when they were actually good. I wish the genre never got
						killed by a <span class="tooltip"
						title="I won't name it here. I also won't forgive it for what it did to the genre.">certain game</span> released in
						2012. If you ever look at a match-3 game and think "oh, it's just another match-3, I hate these games", I
						completely understand why. However, I highly recommend playing a game from the original Bejeweled trilogy
						(especially 3), its <span class="tooltip" title="Please do not play Stars">good spin-offs</span> (Twist or the
						desktop version of Blitz), or any Panel de Pon/Puzzle League game. There are also some fan games made by the
						Bejeweled community, though I haven't got round to playing them yet. The match-3 genre is actually really fun!
					</p>
	
					<p>
						My main in Puyo Puyo (and the PPT games) is Draco, who seems to be a popular choice among people who like to break
						Tetris games. My second favourite character is Ally, who I share my actual name with. As for the Tetris side of the
						PPT cast, you can probably guess who my <span class="tooltip" title=":oyes:">favourite</span> is.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						My mind is blown by the fact Tetris 64's rotation system exists and it's shocking to me how so few people know
						about it. With techniques only seen in Tetris-like stacker games to this day, Tetris 64 was years ahead of its
						time. Tetris Stardust is even more mind-blowing, but its obscurity is much less surprising. I wish the O-Spins and
						Spin Rank mechanics from Tetris Stardust could return in a new Tetris game.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						What's your favourite O-piece rotation? Mine's the O-Fin from Techmino! You can perform this by transforming an
						O-piece into a T-piece, then clearing a Fin TSD with it. It registers as an O-Spin Double!
					</p>
	
					<p>
						I'd love to see or even create a rotation system where you can fin every piece.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						What if there was a stacker that lets you pick a rotation system loadout and swap them out on the fly while
						playing? I can see a mechanic like that adding a great deal of depth.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						I often wonder, how many mainline Tetris games are there, and which ones count as mainline?
					</p>
	
					<p>
						I'm not the only one who noticed there are a disproportionately large number of trans people in some of the weirder
						niches of the Tetris community, right? As a trans person (and the author of an extremely long and detailed guide
						about O-piece rotations) myself, I wonder what it is that draws us to the obscure mechanics in Tetris games.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						This guide is the most <span class="tooltip" title="shocking revelation">autistic</span> thing I've ever written. I
						have been studying O-piece rotations for several months, with the bulk of this guide taking about 3-4 months to
						write. May this hyperfixation continue to bring me dopamine.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						I like purple a normal amount, as I'm sure you can tell. It's much like my love for rotating O-pieces, which is
						also perfectly normal.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						My blood type is <span class="tooltip" title="Yes, really">O</span>. Whenever I make my skirt go spinny, I become a living O-Spin!
					</p>
	
					<p>
						If you ever think you're useless, know that there's a huge guide about how to rotate the square in Tetris. No
						matter what you may think about yourself, you are good for something even if you don't know it yet. I hope you can
						find it one day.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						No O-Spins for transphobes, who are obviously exempt from the above sentiment due to them actually being as useless
						as some memes falsely depict O-piece rotations.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						<strong>Trans rights are human rights!</strong> Here are some flags I made with my playfield code and a few extra
						classes! (I'm all of these btw)
