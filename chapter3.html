				<h3>How To Rotate Your O-Piece</h3>
				<h2>Chapter 3: Non-Guideline Tetris</h2>

				<p>
					Before the Tetris Guideline existed, Tetris games used a variety of rotation systems and game mechanics which aren't
					seen in modern entries. Some of these allow for some very interesting techniques.

					<h3>Tetris The Absolute The Grand Master 2 The RO Medal PLUS</h3>

					<p>
						Tetris The Grand Master 2 (TGM2) features six medals which can be achieved by performing a variety of tasks within
						a single round. One of these medals is the RO (rotation) medal, achieved by maintaining an average of at least 6
						rotations for every 5 pieces. If you do this, you will receive a bronze RO medal at level 300, a silver medal at
						700, and a gold medal at 999.
					</p>

					<p>
						All rotations for all pieces count towards this medal, and it's actually possible to perform a rotation with the
						O-piece on every frame. Mashing the rotation buttons while an O-piece is active will make it much easier to obtain
						this medal.

					<h3>Tetris 64 and its Inexplicably Obscure Rotation System</h3>

					<p>
						By default, Tetris 64 uses Sega Rotation, which was originally made for Sega Tetris (1988) and is the rotation
						system that was adapted for the TGM games. However, this game offers several options to alter how rotations work:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Offset Turn: Enables wall kicks
						</li>
						<li>
							Double Turn: Enables limited 180-degree rotations, usable by double-tapping in a tight space
						</li>
						<li>
							Rotate Center:
							<span class="tooltip" title="YES AN ENTIRE ROTATION SYSTEM I AM NOT EXAGGERATING">
								Enables an alternative, unique rotation system
							</span>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						This game really just dropped an entire rotation system that is unique to Tetris 64 and intentionally permits
						O-Spins via wall kicks in the second page of the options menu. In 1998. And this slipped under most of the Tetris
						community's radar, largely due to it being overshadowed by the Bio Sensor that was included with the game. As cool
						as that is, it bugs me a little that it's commonly perceived as the only thing this game added to the series.
					</p>

					<p>
						Anyway, Rotate Center activates what I call the Tetris 64 Rotation System (<span class="system">T64</span>), as
						it's not known to be used in any other Tetris game. This rotation system defines four distinct rotation states for
						every piece, including the O-piece. Because of this, the O-piece actually moves when rotated. When combined with
						Offset Turn and/or Double Turn, this can be used to execute genuine, developer-intended O-Spins.
					</p>

					<p>
						While I could find some gameplay and a few discussions about this game's unusual spins, I unfortunately couldn't
						find any detailed information about how any of it actually works, such as the rotation states and the specifics of
						how the wall kicks work. I guess this is all I can say about Tetris 64, then-
					</p>

					<p>
						So I decided to lab and document <span class="system">T64</span> (excluding the Bio Tetris polyominoes) myself,
						specifically for a guide about O-piece rotations.
					</p>

					<p>
						Below is an offset chart for the O-piece in <span class="system">T64</span>. The rotation states are in the middle,
						with basic rotations on either side. Then, each rotation has two possible wall kicks, one for each direction. The
						block outlined in black is the rotation centre.
					</p>

					<div class="centre">
						<img src="img/t64_opiece_offset.png" alt="Tetris 64 O-Piece Offset Chart" />
					</div>

					<p>
						Fun Fact: While not relevant to the O-piece, the left kick will always be prioritised over the right kick if both
						would succeed. Because of the wall kick order, this game has a mirrored form of Mihara's Conspiracy, as seen in
						Arika Rotation System (<span class="system">ARS</span>).
					</p>

					<p>
						Below are a few (somewhat) practical O-Spin setups. Unfortunately, the kicks in <span class="system">T64</span>
						limit you to clearing O-Spin Singles. O-Spin Doubles are impossible as there are no wall kicks which move the piece
						downwards. Additionally, spins do not award any bonus points in Tetris 64. Their main utility is to fix misdrops
						and to plan around the game's random piece generator. Alternatively, they're great for flexing on your spectators
						as their jaws drop at your stylish <span class="tooltip" title="O-place piecement">O-piece placement</span> skills.

					<p>
						Practical uses aside, one can have a lot of fun with O-Spins by making some silly setups. Even with such limited
						wall kicks, you can chain them together!
					</p>

					<p>
						However, chaining O-Spins is tricky. Trying to do this like you can in some modern stackers won't work as there are
						no wall kicks that can move the O-piece vertically. Instead, you need to rely on the <span class="state">R</span>
						and <span class="state">2</span> rotation states being one row lower than the other two. This means repeating and
						following the above setups won't allow you to chain spins together as the rotation will either fail or cause the
						piece to move back to where it was before the first rotation.
					</p>

					<p>
						To get around this, you'll need to create a space above subsequent kick setups, allowing you to rotate the piece
						back into the <span class="state">0</span> or <span class="state">L</span> state before performing another wall
						kick.

						With enough chains, something like the setup below should be theoretically possible, allowing one to perform eight

					<p>
						Ah, the one game in this guide I haven't played yet. For the time being, there isn't much I can say about it. Sorry!
					</p>

					<p>
						In this game's Battle mode, clearing a double will cause your opponent to join the piece you used for the line
						clear with their next piece. The attacking piece can then rotate around it. This feature can optionally be enabled
						in single player, allowing you to join the line clear piece to your next piece.

					<h3>Special Block Positioning</h3>

					<p>
						Some Tetris games feature pieces containing special blocks. If an O-piece contains a special block, it can be
						rotated to change its position (unless the piece is composed entirely of special blocks).
					</p>

					<p>
						The Bombliss games (also known as Tetris Blast) have O-pieces which can be made of up to four bomb blocks, so
						rotation may be beneficial if the piece has between one and three bombs. There are several reasons why you would
						want to do this:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Positioning a bomb on a line to be cleared will cause it to explode</li>
						<li>Positioning a bomb away from a line to be cleared can be useful for setting up chain reactions</li>
						<li>Arranging four bombs in a 2x2 square creates a big bomb, which causes a much larger explosion when cleared</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Tetris Battle Gaiden features a similar mechanic with crystals, though instead of exploding, crystals are used to
						charge and activate your character's special attacks. Unlike Bombliss, pieces can only have up to one crystal. You
						may need to rotate an O-piece with a crystal to clear it with a line - it is in your best interest to gather
						crystals as quickly as possible due to how disruptive special attacks can be.

					<h3>Audio Cues [Obsolete]</h3>

					<p>
						To end the non-guideline chapter, I'd like to look at another fun use for O-piece rotations that will be
						impractical for most people. By which I mean everyone, because it turns out the most efficient way to tell if you
						have an O-piece while blindfolded is to simply <em>move</em> it and count how many columns it moves, no rotations
						needed. It's the only piece that can move four columns in both directions from its spawn position.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you'd like to learn how to actually play blindfolded, please disregard what I wrote here and scroll to the
						bottom of the section. I'm leaving this section here though since it is <em>technically</em> something you can do
						with an O-piece rotation.
					</p>

					<div class="obsolete">
						<p>
							Compared to more recent entries, older Tetris games use very primitive rotation systems. This section will
							likely apply to any Tetris game with rotation SFX and no wall kicks, but I'll use Nintendo Rotation System
							(<span class="system">NRS</span>), as seen in NES and Game Boy Tetris, to illustrate audio cues. The rotation
							SFX and lack of wall kicks in these games can be used while blindfolded to determine what your active piece is,
							at least to some extent.
						</p>

						<p>
							The following steps can be applied in NES Tetris:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								Perform a <span class="state">&lt;0L</span> rotation, DAS to the left wall, then attempt an
								<span class="state">L0&gt;</span> rotation. If the <span class="state">L0&gt;</span> rotation succeeds,
								there is a 100% chance you have an O-piece. Yay!
							</li>
							<li>
								If the <span class="state">L0&gt;</span> rotation fails, move one column to the right and try again. If this
								still fails, there is a 100% chance you have an I-piece.
							</li>
							<li>
								If the second <span class="state">L0&gt;</span> rotation succeeds, perform a
								<span class="state">0R&gt;</span> rotation (this will always succeed), then attempt to move the piece 1
								column to the left. If this movement succeeds, then there is a 50% chance you have an S-piece and a 50%
								chance you have a Z-piece.
							</li>
							<li>
								If the movement fails, there is a 33% chance you have a J-piece, a 33% chance you have an L-piece, and a 33%
								chance you have a T-piece.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							GB Tetris instead uses a mirrored, "left-handed" version of <span class="system">NRS</span>, but the above still
							applies if all movements and rotations are mirrored. Beware its 18-height playfield, which will give you less
							time to determine your piece.
