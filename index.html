                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                    To a casual Tetris player, rotating the <span class="tooltip" title="The square piece">O-piece</span> appears to be completely useless. It's the only piece which does not move when you rotate it, and its identical rotation states typically prevent it from interacting with walls or other pieces. But what if there were actually ways to use these seemingly useless rotations to your advantage? As it turns out, many Tetris games and stackers based on the series do actually implement game mechanics which make it useful to rotate the O-piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My name is Dunspixel (she/they). I love playing a variety of stacker games and learning about the mechanical differences between each one. I also have a very strong opinion about O-piece rotations and way too much free time, so I decided to make this guide describing every known use for rotating the O-piece in these games.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rotating the O-piece may be nothing more than a meme to some, but many of the techniques in this guide really are practical and some can be utilised at all skill levels. However, I'm still going to include a variety of useless and whimsical techniques too, simply because they're fun. Useful or otherwise, I hope I can help you appreciate O-piece rotations for what they can really do.

                <h2>Chapter 1: General Concepts</h2>

                <p>
                    Before we begin, I'd like to discuss some concepts that will be useful to understand the techniques in this guide, then go on a brief rant about the semantics of the terms many people use to describe stacker games. If you don't care about that and just want to know some uses for O-piece rotations, you may want to skip to Chapter 2.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="rotation">
                <h3>Rotation</h3>

                <p>
                    When you press a rotation button, your active piece will rotate by 90 degrees in the chosen direction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ok, obvious statements aside, there's actually a lot more going on than most people give it credit for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A piece can be in one of four rotation states. In this guide, I will describe rotation states using "<strong>0R2L</strong>" <span class="tooltip" title="Yes I did this on purpose you can't stop me">rotation notation</span>, in which pieces spawn in state <strong>0</strong>, and rotating right (clockwise) changes to <strong>R</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, <strong>L</strong>, then back to <strong>0</strong>. Likewise, rotating left (anti-clockwise or counter-clockwise) from state <strong>0</strong> will cycle through states <strong>L</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, and <strong>0</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will describe specific rotations (i.e. those where the rotation state is relevant) as combinations of the above rotation states, with an arrow to indicate direction. For example:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A clockwise rotation from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>R</strong> is <strong>0R&gt;</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An anti-clockwise rotation from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>L</strong> is <strong>&lt;0L</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A clockwise 180-degree rotation from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>2</strong> is <strong>0R2&gt;</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A single button 180-degree rotation from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>2</strong> is <strong>&lt;02&gt;</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You may be wondering how a <strong>0R2&gt;</strong> rotation differs from a <strong>&lt;02&gt;</strong> rotation. There's actually one game in this guide that implements 180-degree rotations like those featured in the Puyo Puyo series, where you can flip a piece by quickly double-tapping a rotation button in a tight space. Rotations like these technically work differently from 180-degree rotations triggered by a single button press, hence the different notation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In many stackers (especially modern Tetris games), the O-piece can have multiple rotation states even if each one is identical. This means the O-piece is actually rotating internally even if there is no visual feedback for doing so. In the commonly used Super Rotation System, or <strong>SRS</strong> for short, the O-piece internally rotates around one of its blocks (the lower-left block in state <strong>0</strong>), but an offset is applied to keep it in place when rotated.

                <h3>Wall Kicks</h3>

                <p>
                    Wall kicks are a feature of many modern rotation systems, which allow pieces to move when rotated if their new position is obstructed by a wall or another piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In SRS, four alternative positions are checked if basic rotation fails, and the piece will move to the first one that succeeds. For example, this is how the infamous Fin TSD works in SRS:

                    Different rotation systems can handle wall kicks by defining a different offset table, or instead try to kick by rotating around an alternate centre. Regardless of implementation, they're super fun to use once you know how they work!

                <h3>Wiki Links</h3>

                <p>
                    You may have noticed that I provide two very similar wiki links for many of the sections in this guide. Hard Drop and TetrisWiki are both fantastic community resources for information about Tetris games, but many of the pages have very similar content due to being forked from the now-defunct Tetrisconcept wiki, and editors adding content to both wikis at the same time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Which one you pick is really down to personal preference, though if there's something you can't find on one wiki, you will probably be able to find it on the other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even though past proposals to merge the wikis have been rejected, the Tetris community generally agrees that both of them are <strong>significantly</strong> better than the Fandom wiki, which I recommend you avoid.

                <h3>"Versions of Tetris"?</h3>

                <p>
                    So this section is that rant about semantics I mentioned earlier, which you'll hopefully find somewhat educational and/or entertaining. I'd love to know what other people think about this topic!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also, I hope this rant doesn't come across as too negative or angry. I'm not mad at any of you, I promise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Am I the only one who is bothered by different Tetris games, and stackers in general, being referred to as "versions of Tetris"? It's a term which perpetuates the myth that the Tetris series is literally just the same game ported to pretty much every device imaginable, and that Tetris-like stackers are just knock-offs of what they perceive to be the "real thing".
                </p>

                <p>
                    This isn't helped at all by the fact that even The Tetris Company, who licenses the Tetris series, refers to their own games as "versions" of the same game instead of what they are: entries in a series.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sure, the original Tetris was the first stacker game. It did indeed start the genre of puzzle games which many people in the Tetris community name after it. But to say that they're all just the exact same game is plainly wrong.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While all (tetromino-based) stacker games may superficially look identical to each other, they all feel very different to play at anything higher than a casual level. This is even true of modern Tetris games which have to adhere to the Tetris Guideline. Some examples of differences which drastically affect gameplay include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game modes</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Rotation systems</strong></li>
                    <li>Piece randomisers</li>
                    <li>Available drop types (soft, hard, sonic)</li>

                    <li>Spin recognition</li>
                    <li>Lock delay (or lack of it)</li>
                    <li>Timings (e.g. DAS and ARR)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    To clear up some terms related to stacker games, this is how I use them in this guide:
                </p>

                <ul>

                            <li>
                                Includes the Tetris series and all Tetris-like stackers

                            <li>
                                May use pieces other than tetrominoes or feature non-tetromino modes (outside the scope of this guide)

                <h2>Chapter 2: Guideline Tetris</h2>

                <p>
                    The Tetris Guideline is a document which developers of Tetris games follow to ensure each game has some degree of mechanical consistency. The first Tetris game to follow the Tetris Guideline, at least in the form which evolved into what we know today, is Tetris Worlds from 2001. Almost every Tetris game released since then has adhered to some version of this guideline, hence why modern Tetris games are often referred to as "Guideline Tetris".
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most important feature of the Tetris Guideline is the aforementioned SRS, which it introduced to the Tetris series. We'll encounter a lot of rotation systems in this guide, but SRS is by far the one you'll see the most both in modern Tetris games and in Tetris-like stackers.
                </p>

                <h3>Move-Reset Lock Delay</h3>

                <p>
                    Finally! I get to talk about an actual use for O-piece rotations! This one is by far the most practical O-piece rotation technique you can use in the Tetris series at any skill level. If you only learn one thing from this guide, let it be this.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Many Tetris games, including all guideline games, implement a lock delay. This means when the active piece reaches the bottom of the board or the top of the stack, the game provides a brief window of time (typically 30 frames or half a second) to move or rotate the piece before it locks into place.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Move-Reset Lock Delay, as implemented in most guideline Tetris games, resets whenever the active piece is moved or rotated. Earlier guideline games such as Tetris Worlds and Tetris DS allow you to do this indefinitely, while later games impose a limit of 15 resets per piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Repeatedly resetting the lock delay just before the piece locks is called "stalling". This is a versatile technique which is useful at a variety of skill levels, especially in multiplayer battles. Some examples include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Giving yourself extra time to decide where to place a piece
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delaying a line clear in battle to block or mitigate an incoming attack that would cause you to top out
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delaying a <span class="tooltip" title="piecement places">piece placement</span> to receive garbage lines from an imminent attack, then using this garbage for a counterspike
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If your active piece is an O-piece, then all of this can be achieved by rotating it while it's on the floor. In tight areas, many pieces can wall kick to unexpected places when rotated, especially if you're less familiar with SRS. Because the O-piece does not move on rotation in guideline Tetris games, it is the easiest and safest piece to use when stalling.

                <h3>Tetris Effect and Initial Rotation</h3>

                <p>
                    Tetris Effect features two major mechanics which make O-piece rotations especially useful when used together:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Zone, which stops time and allows you to perform massive line clears
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Initial Rotation System (<strong>IRS</strong>), which allows you to spawn pieces in a pre-rotated state
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Quite possibly one of the best things added to Tetris
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When using Zone to clear 20 <span class="tooltip" title="kirb your ultimatris">or more</span> lines at once, you have limited space to spawn and manoeuvre pieces without topping out and ending the zone. To prevent topping out prematurely, hold the rotation button on your active piece while placing it, which will activate IRS and spawn the next piece rotated in that direction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With most pieces, if your active piece is already in the desired rotation state and you are not already holding the appropriate rotation button, you must first perform a counter-rotation in the opposite direction to the required spawn state for the next piece, which will then allow you to rotate it back and hard-drop the piece while that rotation button is still held.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thanks to its identical rotation states, the O-piece eliminates the need for the counter-rotation, thus making it the easiest piece to use with IRS.

                <h3>Puyo Puyo Tetris and Fusion "O-Spins"</h3>

                <p>
                    This is much more whimsical than the other uses in this chapter, having pretty much zero practical use. However, seeing an O-piece wall kick in a modern guideline Tetris game and the ridiculous setup it requires is absolutely hilarious and I love it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Puyo Puyo Tetris implements a slightly altered SRS offset table which defines wall kicks for the O-piece. These wall kicks effectively undo the offset applied to the internal rotation of the O-piece and were mainly implemented for use with its equivalent pentomino, the P-piece, in the game's Party mode.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Triggering this wall kick for the standard O-piece is much tricker and can only be done in the game's Fusion mode. This mode combines Puyo Puyo with Tetris on the same board, introducing some unusual behaviour when Puyos and Tetris pieces interact with each other. By soft dropping a piece on top of a Puyo stack, the Tetris piece will slowly break through the stack, and activate the next piece which you can use at the same time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a complex setup which allows you to exploit this behaviour and execute an O-spin:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A Tetris stack with a two wide, minimum four high well</li>
                    <li>Puyos filling the well in this stack</li>
                    <li>An overhang above the well, with enough space to the side and underneath to fit an O-piece</li>
                    <li>A fully enclosed O-shaped hole inside this overhang, with the floor being one block high</li>
                    <li>Access to two consecutive O-pieces via the next and/or hold queues</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    First, slide the first O-piece under the overhang and allow it to lock on top of the puyo stack. Once it locks, it will slowly break through the puyo stack.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the second O-piece spawns (or you take it out of hold), perform a <strong>0R&gt;</strong> rotation. You can then use the time spent by the first piece breaking through the puyo stack to move the second O-piece to the same place. You'll want to time it so the first piece reaches the bottom and clears the lines before the second piece is affected by gravity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the lines are cleared, your second O-piece will be pushed into the ceiling (or the floor of the hole). When this happens, perform an <strong>&lt;R0</strong> rotation and your O-piece will kick upwards, filling the hole and completing the O-Spin.
                </p>

                <h3>Tetris Stardust and Actual O-Spins</h3>

                <p>
                    Ok, maybe you're thinking that last section was a bit too silly. Perhaps you're looking for an O-Spin in a guideline Tetris game that is developer intended and doesn't require a ludicrous setup. You're probably also wondering if such a game really exists in the Tetris series. Good news, it does, and it's called Tetris Stardust!
                </p>

                <p>
                    To tell you the truth, I only recently learned this game existed, mainly because it's a game that was only released in Japan, made using Silverlight of all things, and there is very little information about it online. It's mostly based on Tetris Online, but with a few important differences. As you can probably tell by the existence of this section, some of these differences have something to do with how the O-piece behaves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tetris Stardust primarily uses SRS just like any other guideline Tetris game, but there is a special case which allows the O-piece to wall kick. Unusually for a game with O-piece kicks, the O-piece doesn't actually move on normal rotation, nor does it have multiple distinct rotation states (though it does technically have four identical states). Instead, it checks the following conditions and bypasses basic rotation if the check succeeds:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If rotating left, the space directly underneath the <strong>lower-right</strong> block must be occupied.</li>
                    <li>If rotating right, the space directly underneath the <strong>lower-left</strong> block must be occupied.</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="img/stardust_opiece_offset.png" class="inline-end" alt="Tetris Stardust O-Piece Offset Table" />

                <p>
                    If the check succeeds, the O-piece will then kick according to the offset table to the right. To my knowledge, Tetris Stardust is the only Tetris game which actually acknowledges O-Spins by name, and also the only one which explicitly rewards them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to the points scored by O-Spins and their associated line clears, the act of performing these spins awards points based on a "Spin Rank" system unique to this game. There are a total of 10 Spin Ranks: E, D, C, B, A-, A, A+, S-, S, and S+. Any kick that would cause the Spin Rank to exceed S+ will simply award an S+.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Spin Rank is particularly useful because it awards points without clearing lines, and the aim of Tetris Stardust is to score as many points as possible in 40 lines.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Spin Rank is awarded for each kick which moves the piece below its previous lowest block. This means kicks which move the piece upwards or only move horizontally will not award Spin Rank. This also prevents you from gaining Spin Rank by repeatedly performing a kick, then the opposite kick to move it back to its previous position. Score for Spin Rank is awarded per wall kick, so performing multiple rank-eligible kicks with the same piece will award multiple score bonuses. For example, a C-Rank spin (200 points) followed by a B-Rank spin (400 points) performed with the same piece will award a total of 600 points, not just the 400 for the final spin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the O-Piece, Kick 1 does not award Spin Rank, Kick 2 has a base Spin Rank of C, and Kicks 3 and 4 have a base Spin Rank of A. Chaining multiple kicks together will increase Spin Rank based on the rank of the previous kick:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>E, D, C: +1</li>
                    <li>B, A-: +2</li>
                    <li>A, A+, S-: +3</li>
                    <li>S, S+: +4</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Here are some examples of chained spins and the ranks they award. All of these setups can be mirrored, though you will need to rotate in the opposite direction.
                </p>

                    A-Rank spins add a +3 bonus to following spins, so chaining two of them together increases the second spin to rank S. Following this, the S-Rank spin will add a +4 bonus to the next spin, so a third A-Rank spin will be increased to the maximum Spin Rank of S+. The total Spin Rank bonus for the first two spins is 2400, while the third increases the total to 4200. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The inner workings of Spin Rank are actually much more complicated than this, but even though I ran the game through a decompiler and tried to read this part of the game logic, hell if I can actually understand it. The spins with a base rank of A actually have an internal base rank of B, but there's a "rotation level" which triggers a thing which increases this B to A. I can't for the life of me figure out why this isn't also being applied to the C-Rank spins. Perhaps what I think are the C-Rank spins don't actually have a defined Spin Rank and they're defaulting to E (because E-Rank is 0 internally)?

                <p>
                    Some Guideline-era games actually implement <em>step-reset</em> lock delay instead of move-reset. This means the lock delay only resets when your active piece moves downwards due to gravity or soft-drop, for example when moving a piece down a staircase-like stack. This prevents you from stalling by rotating a piece while it is on the floor and typically removes all utility for O-piece rotations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These games include:

                                This game does have IRS, with the first TGM game introducing it to the series, but it also has a much longer piece entry delay. It's more useful to use IRS during this delay, unlike in Tetris Effect where it's only a few frames.

                                To my knowledge, there is no use for rotating the O-piece in this particular game. I still love it, though.

                    Before the Tetris Guideline existed, Tetris games used a variety of rotation systems and game mechanics which aren't seen in modern entries. Some of these allow for some very interesting techniques.

                    Tetris The Grand Master 2 (TGM2) features six medals which can be achieved by performing a variety of tasks within a single round. One of these medals is the RO (rotation) medal, achieved by maintaining an average of at least 6 rotations for every 5 pieces. If you do this, you will receive a bronze RO medal at level 300, a silver medal at 700, and a gold medal at 999.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All rotations for all pieces count towards this medal, and it's actually possible to perform a rotation with the O-piece on every frame. Mashing the rotation buttons while an O-piece is active will make it much easier to obtain this medal.

                <h3>Tetris 64 and its Inexplicably Obscure Rotation System</h3>

                <p>
                    By default, Tetris 64 uses Sega Rotation, which was originally made for Sega Tetris (1988) and is the rotation system that was adapted for the TGM games. However, this game offers several options to alter how rotations work:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Offset Turn: Enables wall kicks
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Double Turn: Enables limited 180-degree rotations, usable by double-tapping in a tight space
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rotate Center:
                        <span class="tooltip" title="YES AN ENTIRE ROTATION SYSTEM I AM NOT EXAGGERATING">
                            Enables an alternative, unique rotation system
                        </span>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This game really just dropped an entire rotation system that is unique to Tetris 64 and intentionally permits O-Spins via wall kicks in the second page of the options menu. In 1998. And this slipped under most of the Tetris community's radar, largely due to it being overshadowed by the Bio Sensor that was included with the game. As cool as that is, it bugs me a little that it's commonly perceived as the only thing this game added to the series.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anyway, Rotate Center activates what I call the Tetris 64 Rotation System, as it's not known to be used in any other Tetris game. This rotation system defines four distinct rotation states for every piece, including the O-piece. Because of this, the O-piece actually moves when rotated. When combined with Offset Turn and/or Double Turn, this can be used to execute genuine, developer-intended O-Spins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While I could find some gameplay and a few discussions about this game's unusual spins, I unfortunately couldn't find any detailed information about how any of it actually works, such as the rotation states and the specifics of how the wall kicks work. I guess this is all I can say about Tetris 64, then-
                </p>

                <p>
                    So I decided to lab and document the Tetris 64 rotation system (excluding the Bio Tetris polyminoes) myself, specifically for a guide <span class="tooltip" title="If you couldn't tell by now, yes I am autistic">about O-piece rotations</span>.
                </p>

                <img src="img/t64_opiece_offset.png" class="inline-end" alt="Tetris 64 O-Piece Offset Table" />

                <p>
                    To the right is an offset table for the O-piece. The rotation states are in the middle, with basic rotations on either side. Then, each rotation has two possible wall kicks, one for each direction. The left kick will always be prioritised over the right kick if both would succeed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fun Fact: Because of the wall kick order, this game has a mirrored form of Mihara's Conspiracy, as seen in Arika Rotation System (<strong>ARS</strong>).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below are a few (somewhat) practical O-Spin setups. Unfortunately, the kicks in Tetris 64 limit you to clearing O-Spin Singles. O-Spin Doubles are impossible as there are no wall kicks which move the piece downwards. Additionally, spins do not award any bonus points in Tetris 64. Their main utility is to fix misdrops and to plan around the game's random piece generator. Alternatively, they're great for flexing on your spectators as their jaws drop at your stylish O-piece placement skills.
                </p>

                    <li>This can also be performed with an <strong>L0R&gt;</strong> rotation.</li>

                <p>
                    Practical uses aside, one can have a lot of fun with O-Spins by making some silly setups. Even with such limited wall kicks, you can chain them together!
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, chaining O-Spins is tricky. Trying to do this like you can in some modern stackers won't work as there are no wall kicks that can move the O-piece vertically. Instead, you need to rely on the <strong>R</strong> and <strong>2</strong> rotation states being one row lower than the other two. This means repeating and following the above setups won't allow you to chain spins together as the rotation will either fail or cause the piece to move back to where it was before the first rotation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To get around this, you'll need to create a space above subsequent kick setups, allowing you to rotate the piece back into the <strong>0</strong> or <strong>L</strong> state before performing another wall kick.

                <p>
                    With enough setups like this, something like the setup below should be theoretically possible, allowing one to perform eight O-Spins before clearing an O-Spin Single. I'd love to see a TAS which creates and executes it.

                    Summary: In this game's Battle mode, clearing a double will cause your opponent to join the piece you used for the line clear with their next piece. The attacking piece can then rotate around it. This feature can optionally be enabled in single player, allowing you to join the line clear piece to your next piece.

                <h3>Audio Cues</h3>

                <p>
                    To end the non-guideline section, I'd like to look at another fun use for O-piece rotations that will be impractical for most people. However, if you like beating scores in blindfolded categories, this may still be useful for you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Compared to more recent entries, older Tetris games use very primitive rotation systems. This section will likely apply to any Tetris game with rotation SFX and no wall kicks, but I'll use Nintendo Rotation System (<strong>NRS</strong>), as seen in NES and Game Boy Tetris, to illustrate audio cues. The rotation SFX and lack of wall kicks in these games can be used while blindfolded to determine what your active piece is, at least to some extent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The following steps can be applied in NES Tetris:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Perform a <strong>&lt;0L</strong> rotation, DAS to the left wall, then attempt an <strong>L0&gt;</strong> rotation. If the <strong>L0&gt;</strong> rotation succeeds, there is a 100% chance you have an O-piece. Yay!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the <strong>L0&gt;</strong> rotation fails, move one column to the right and try again. If this still fails, there is a 100% chance you have an I-piece.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the second <strong>L0&gt;</strong> rotation succeeds, perform a <strong>0R&gt;</strong> rotation (this will always succeed), then attempt to move the piece 1 column to the left. If this movement succeeds, then there is a 50% chance you have an S-piece and a 50% chance you have a Z-piece.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the movement fails, there is a 33% chance you have a J-piece, a 33% chance you have an L-piece, and a 33% chance you have a T-piece.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unfortunately, I don't yet know of any ways to distinguish S/Z and J/L/T. If you do, please let me know!
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    GB Tetris instead uses a mirrored, "left-handed" version of NRS, but the above still applies if all movements and rotations are mirrored. Beware its 18-height playfield, which will give you less time to determine your piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While it's <span class="tooltip" title="I eagerly wait for the Classic Tetris community to prove me wrong">not possible</span> to play indefinitely without exceptional luck, the above steps can theoretically be used to clear a decent amount of lines before topping out.

                <h2>Chapter 4: Tetris-like Stackers</h2>

                <p>
                    Outside of the Tetris series is an entire genre inspired by it. These games, as well as Tetris, are known as stackers. As they are not bound by the Tetris Guideline, these stackers can be much more creative with how pieces behave and interact with each other, introducing a variety of new game mechanics that can set them apart from Tetris. Many stackers implement custom rotation systems which introduce unique ways to rotate O-pieces and execute O-spins.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Unless otherwise specified, the techniques described for each game are performed with that game's default rotation system. Many community-made stacker games allow the selection of rotation systems from other games, which would permit the use of those games' O-piece rotation techniques. However, describing them in each game that uses them would result in far too much repetition.

                <h3>Ascension and its Extensive Wall Kicks</h3>

                <p>
                    While Ascension (<strong>ASC</strong>) features highly customisable pieces which allow you to play with any type of polymino that can fit in a 5x5 grid, I'll be describing things based on the default tetromino set. With that said, this game's O-Spin techniques should be generally applicable to any custom O-piece regardless of where you put its centre block as all pieces use the same offset table.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ASC uses an offset table which defines a massive 21 wall kicks for when basic rotation fails. In addition, because pieces are defined in a 5x5 area, the O-piece will always have a centre which allows it to move on rotation.

                <h3>Nuketris and Worm Mode</h3>

                <p>
                    Nuketris primarily uses the <strong>SRS-X</strong> rotation system first used in Heboris Unofficial Expansion, and later Nullpomino. <strong>SRS-X</strong> works exactly like <strong>SRS</strong> when rotating 90 degrees, but it has an extensive 180-degree offset table that defines 11 wall kicks for each rotation (as opposed to the 4 wall kicks for the 90-degree rotations).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unlike the original <strong>SRS-X</strong> however, the O-piece rotation states have been modified so it now has four distinct states. The O-piece starts with its rotation centre at the bottom-right block, and will move on rotation. It can then kick using the same offset table as the rest of the pieces, with the exception of the I-piece which uses its own table.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nuketris also features a unique mode called Worm, which involves navigating an O-piece through an infinite tunnel which ascends at increasing speeds using O-Spins and your knowledge of wall kicks. You must survive for as long as possible without topping out due to your O-piece being pushed above the ceiling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Needless to say, I love this mode!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below is an illustration of the O-piece offset table for Nuketris. The block outlined in black is the rotation centre, while the block highlighted in orange, diagonally opposite the rotation centre, shows how the rotation state is displayed in Worm mode.
                </p>

                <div class="centre">
                    <img src="img/nuketris_opiece_offset.png" alt="Nuketris O-Piece Offset Table" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    There are some 90-degree kicks here that move the O-piece back to its original position. These kicks are guaranteed to succeed, so any kicks defined after them are completely inaccessible. <strong>0R&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;R0</strong>, <strong>2L&gt;</strong>, and <strong>&lt;L2</strong> rotations are only useful for changing the rotation state because of this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Worm mode, the tunnel is made out of three-column spaces inside a wall of garbage blocks. For each row, the space will move left or right by one column, ensuring there will always be enough space for the O-piece to move. Because of this tunnel generation rule, we can actually rule out a lot of the above wall kicks as being inaccessible in Worm mode (unless you kick the piece above the tunnel at the beginning for some reason). We can rule out kicks for the following reasons:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The rotation and kick only move the piece horizontally (will be blocked by the wall)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rotation and kick only move the piece one or two spaces downwards (will be blocked by the floor)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The kick moves the piece far enough horizontally that the tunnel will never reach the O-piece's destination, even if it continues in a single direction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The kick is defined after another kick that will always succeed
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Below is the same offset table, but only showing the wall kicks relevant to Worm mode.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Each state and rotation has use cases that make them useful, though generally speaking, the <strong>0</strong> and <strong>R</strong> states have more desirable kicks. States can also be divided into pairs, as the <strong>0</strong>/<strong>R</strong> ("upper") and <strong>2</strong>/<strong>L</strong> ("lower") state pairs are effectively interchangeable due to the 90-degree rotations between them that switch states without moving the piece.

                <h3>Techmino and Transformative O-Spins</h3>

                <p>
                    Techmino Rotation System (<strong>TRS</strong>) functions mostly like SRS, but with a few exceptions. It just so happens that one of these exceptions is how O-pieces behave when you perform very specific rotations in certain situations - it transforms into other pieces and can be used to execute spins which the game registers as O-Spins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Transformative O-Spins can be performed by moving an O-piece somewhere you would normally perform a spin with a different piece, then performing the relevant rotation sequence from the list below. Note that "F" is short for "Flip" and refers to the game's 180-degree rotation button.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>T: LLL, RRR</li>
                    <li>Z: LRL, RLR</li>
                    <li>S: RLR, LRL</li>
                    <li>J: LLR, RRL (depending on spin)</li>
                    <li>L: RRL, LLR (depending on spin)</li>
                    <li>I: FFF</li>
                    <li>O: RFR, RRF, RFF, LFL, LLF, LFF (depending on kick)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Specifically, this performs an "immovable" check on the O-piece (can the O-piece move down, left, or right) and the piece it is transforming into (can the new piece move in any direction). An exception to this is the I-piece, which only checks whether it is <em>vertically</em> immovable. If both of the checks see that the piece cannot move after the rotation sequence is entered, the piece will transform.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Interestingly, the T transformations are defined slightly differently for LLL and RRR - the "T-Spin Mini" transformations only work when rotating in a specific direction. This is also true for the J and L pieces, whose different spin sequences have completely different use cases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once an O-piece is transformed, it will rotate and kick exactly like the piece it transformed into. You can also hold it and use it later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My Lua reading skills are limited, but from what I understand (and confirmed by testing), these are all of the setups permitted by the O-Spin table in the order they are defined. Blocks coloured like the other pieces are for illustration purposes only - they show where the O-piece will kick to.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fun Fact: Because the "T-Spin Mini" spins don't require a two-high wall opposite the overhang, the O-piece is actually slightly better at T-Spin Triples in this scenario than the actual T-piece. However, the T-piece can be used when there is no wall here while the O-piece cannot. This is also true of J and L-Spin Triples!
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are also some translational O-Spins, triggered by different rotation sequences. These do not appear to transform the O-piece, but they do technically transform the O-piece into itself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a distinction without a difference and has no effect on gameplay, but it would be a very funny hill for me to die on if you try to tell me it doesn't transform (unless you happen to be a Techmino developer and I genuinely missed something, in which case this would be very embarrassing for me).

                <h3>Jstris and O-Spin Memes</h3>

                <p>
                    This one is very silly, even being described by the game's guide as a "meme rotation system". Fortunately, I'm a very silly person who considers it to be in the scope of this guide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jstris features a config option called "Blocks" which defines the piece set and rotation system. One of these options is "O-Spin", which has two distinct features. First, it vastly broadens the offset table so that each piece can utilise 16 wall kicks instead of the 4 possible in SRS (the default in Jstris). Second, it permits two absolutely ridiculous O-Spins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first O-Spin (an O-Spin Triple) is performed by creating a T-Spin Triple setup where the T is "pointing" to the right. When the O-piece is placed next to the overhang, rotating it to the right will transform it into an L-piece. Rotating right again will transform it into a T-piece and fill the T-shaped hole, though this is still an "O-Spin" in a similar vein to Techmino's transformations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second O-Spin (an O-Spin Quadruple) is performed by creating a 4x4 space with a 2x2 space touching its top-right corner. Placing an O-piece in the 2x2 space and rotating left will transform it into a 4x4 O-piece and kick it to the larger space.
                </p>

                <h3>TETR.IO and All-Spin</h3>

                <p>
                    While TETR.IO does implement O-Spin recognition, O-piece rotations don't really have any practical use (aside from the previously mentioned stalling techniques) with the game's default rotation system, SRS+. However, there are a few fun things you can do with them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    TETR.IO offers several options for spin recognition, such as:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>T-Spins: Only recognises T-Spins as spins</li>
                    <li>All-Spin: Recognises spins for all pieces</li>
                    <li>Stupid: Recognises every floor rotation as a "spin"</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Of course, setting the allowed spins to "Stupid" will allow you to O-Spin with every O-piece, but it's clear that this is just a novelty feature and it makes it feel a bit too easy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    O-Spins can still be executed when allowed spins is set to "All-Spin", though it's still very impractical. This was probably intended for use with the game's other rotation system options based on other stacker games, but it can actually be executed in SRS, too. If an O-shaped hole is pushed up to the exact location where the O-piece spawns, or if a custom map is created where such a hole already exists, rotating the piece there will register as an O-Spin.
                </p>

                    Tetris Effect is not a rhythm game. Rather, you are a rhythm game which Tetris Effect plays perfectly. Tetris Effect has exactly one rhythm-based game mechanic and it requires you to be dead in Connected mode to utilise it.

                    My main in Puyo Puyo (and by extension PPT/PPT2) is Draco, with my second favourite being Ally. Sadly, I'm <em>shockingly</em> bad at Puyo. Fun Fact: Ally is also my actual name!

                <p>
                    My mind is blown by the fact Tetris 64's rotation system exists and it's shocking to me how so few people know about it. With techniques only seen in Tetris-like stacker games to this day, Tetris 64 was years ahead of its time. Tetris Stardust is even more mind-blowing, but its obscurity is much less surprising.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I wish the O-Spins and Spin Rank mechanics from Tetris Stardust could return in a new Tetris game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While looking through a decompilation of Tetris Stardust, I found that the internal score values are (mostly) consistent with Guideline scoring. However, when actually playing the game, these score values are doubled when you clear lines, even though the internal "level" variable (and by extension, score multiplier) is always 1. Please tell me if you know why these score values are being doubled, because I can't find what's causing it.
                </p>

                    What's your favourite O-piece rotation? Mine's the O-Fin from Techmino! You can perform this by transforming an O-piece into a T-piece, then clearing a Fin TSD with it. It registers as an O-Spin Double!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd love to see or even create a rotation system where you can fin every piece.

                    I often wonder, how many mainline Tetris games are there, and which ones count as mainline?

                    If you ever think you're useless, know that there's a huge guide about how to rotate the square in Tetris. No matter what you may think about yourself, you are good for something even if you don't know it yet. I hope you can find it one day.

                    If you just scrolled all the way to the bottom, you're reading the Random Ramblings section! The actual guide is structured better than this!

                    <strong>Trans rights are human rights!</strong> Here are some flags I made with my playfield code! (I'm all of these btw)
