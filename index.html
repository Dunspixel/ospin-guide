                    Note: This guide is a work in progress. Some sections are missing or incomplete, and there may be some factual errors
                    due to incomplete research.

                    To a casual Tetris player, rotating the <span class="tooltip" title="Also known as the 'square'">O-piece</span>
                    appears to be completely useless. It's the only piece which does not move when you rotate it, and its identical rotation
                    states typically prevent it from interacting with walls or other pieces. However, it turns out many stacker games both
                    within and outside the Tetris series do actually implement game mechanics which can make it advantageous to rotate the
                    O-piece.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    My name is <span class="tooltip" title="she/they">Dunspixel</span>. I love playing a variety of Tetris games and
                    learning about the mechanical differences between each one. I also have a very strong opinion about O-piece rotations
                    and way too much free time, so I decided to make this comprehensive guide describing every known use for rotating the
                    O-piece in the Tetris series and a variety of Tetris-like stacker games created by game developers in the Tetris
                    community.

                <p>
                    Rotating the O-piece may be nothing more than a meme to some, but many of the techniques in this guide really are
                    practical and some can be utilised at all skill levels. With that said, I'm still going to include some useless and
                    whimsical setups and techniques too, simply because they're fun. Useful or otherwise, I hope I can help you appreciate
                    O-piece rotations for what they can really do.

                <h2>Guideline Tetris</h2>

                <p>
                    First of all, let's talk about the Tetris Guideline. It's a document which developers of Tetris games follow to ensure
                    each game has some degree of mechanical consistency. The first Tetris game to follow the Tetris Guideline, at least in
                    the form which evolved into what we know today, is Tetris Worlds from 2001.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most important feature of the Tetris Guideline is the Super Rotation System, or SRS for short. We'll encounter a lot
                    of rotation systems in this guide, but SRS is by far the one you'll see the most both in modern Tetris and in
                    Tetris-like stackers. In short, SRS defines how pieces behave when they rotate, and how they can move if rotation causes
                    them to collide with a wall or another piece.
                </p>

                <ul class="sources">

                    <h3>Rotations and Wall Kicks</h3>

                    <p>
                        Since this doesn't include any specific uses for O-piece rotations, I'll keep it short.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Pieces can be in one of four orientations. For the purpose of this guide, I will be describing them using the "0R2L"
                        <span class="tooltip" title="Yes I did this on purpose you can't stop me">rotation notation</span>, where pieces
                        spawn in the 0 orientation, and rotating clockwise changes to R, 2, L, then back to 0.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I will describe specific rotations (i.e. those where the orientation is relevant) as combinations of the above
                        orientations. For example, a clockwise rotation from 0 to R will be written as "0R", a clockwise 180-degree rotation
                        from 0 to 2 will be written as "0R2", and a single button 180-degree rotation from 0 to 2 will be written as "02".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Wall kicks are a feature of many modern rotation systems, which allow pieces to move when rotated if their new
                        position is obstructed by a wall or another piece. In SRS, four alternative positions are checked if basic rotation
                        fails, and the piece will move to the first one that succeeds. Different rotation systems may define different
                        offsets, or instead try to kick by rotating around an alternate centre.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Move-Reset Lock Delay</h3>

                    <p>
                        Finally! I get to talk about an actual use for O-piece rotations! This one is by far the most practical O-piece
                        rotation technique you can use in the Tetris series at any skill level. Seriously, even if you only learn one thing
                        from this guide, let it be this.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Many Tetris games, including all guideline games, implement a lock delay. This means when the active piece reaches
                        the bottom of the board or the top of the stack, the game provides a brief window of time (typically 30 frames or
                        half a second) to move or rotate the piece before it locks into place.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Move-Reset Lock Delay, as implemented in
                        <span class="tooltip" title="A notable exception is Tetris Giant, which uses step-reset lock delay">most</span>
                        guideline Tetris games, resets whenever the active piece is moved or rotated. Earlier guideline games such as Tetris
                        Worlds and Tetris DS allow you to do this indefinitely, while later games impose a limit of 15 resets per piece.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Repeatedly resetting the lock delay just before the piece locks is called "stalling". This is a versatile technique
                        which is useful at a variety of skill levels, especially in multiplayer battles. Some examples include:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Giving yourself extra time to decide where to place a piece
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Delaying a line clear in battle to block or mitigate an incoming attack that would cause you to top out
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Delaying a <span class="tooltip" title="piecement places">piece placement</span> to receive garbage lines
                                from an imminent attack, then using this garbage for a counterspike
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If your active piece is an O-piece, then all of this can be achieved by rotating it while it's on the floor. In
                        tight areas, many pieces can wall kick to unexpected places when rotated, especially if you're less familiar with
                        SRS. Because the O-piece does not move on rotation in guideline Tetris games, it is the easiest and safest piece to
                        use when stalling.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Tetris Effect and Initial Rotation</h3>

                    <p>
                        Tetris Effect features two major mechanics which make O-piece rotations especially useful when used together:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Zone, which stops time and allows you to perform massive line clears
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Initial Rotation System (IRS), which allows you to spawn pieces in a pre-rotated state and is quite possibly one
                            of the best things added to Tetris
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        When using Zone to clear 20 <span class="tooltip" title="kirb your ultimatris">or more</span> lines at once, you
                        have limited space to spawn and manoeuvre pieces without topping out and ending the zone. To prevent topping out
                        prematurely, hold the rotation button on your active piece while placing it, which will activate IRS and spawn the
                        next piece rotated in that direction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With most pieces, if your active piece is already in the desired orientation and you are not already holding the
                        appropriate rotation button, you must first perform a counter-rotation in the opposite direction to the required
                        spawn orientation for the next piece, which will then allow you to rotate it back and hard-drop the piece while that
                        rotation button is still held.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thanks to its identical rotation states, the O-piece eliminates the need for the counter-rotation, thus making it
                        the easiest piece to use with IRS.

                    <h3>Puyo Puyo Tetris and Fusion O-Spins</h3>

                    <p>
                        This is much more whimsical than the other uses in this chapter, having pretty much zero practical use. However,
                        seeing an O-piece wall kick in a modern guideline Tetris game is absolutely hilarious and I love it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Puyo Puyo Tetris implements a slightly altered SRS offset table which defines wall kicks for the O-piece. These wall
                        kicks effectively undo the offset applied to the internal rotation of the O-piece and were mainly implemented for
                        use with its equivalent pentomino, the P-piece, in the game's Party mode.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Triggering this wall kick for the standard O-piece is much tricker and can only be done in the game's Fusion mode.
                        This mode combines Puyo Puyo with Tetris on the same board, introducing some unusual behaviour when Puyos and Tetris
                        pieces interact with each other. By soft dropping a piece on top of a Puyo stack, the Tetris piece will slowly break
                        through the stack, and activate the next piece which you can use at the same time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There is a complex setup which allows you to exploit this behaviour and execute an O-spin:
                        <span class="todo">TODO: Add a screenshot</span>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A Tetris stack with a two wide, minimum two high well (preferably higher)</li>
                        <li>Puyos filling the well in this stack</li>
                        <li>An overhang above the well, with enough space to the side and underneath to fit an O-piece</li>
                        <li>A fully enclosed O-shaped hole inside this overhang, with the floor being one block high</li>
                        <li>Access to two consecutive O-pieces via the next and/or hold queues</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        By sliding the first O-piece under the overhang and soft-dropping it onto the Puyo stack, you can use the time spent
                        breaking the Puyo stack to place the second O-piece on top of where the first piece locked and perform a 0R rotation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When the first piece reaches the bottom, it will clear the two lines at the bottom of the stack and shift the
                        overhang downwards, causing the floor of the O-shaped hole to overlap with the O-piece. Just after the line clear,
                        performing a R0 rotation will then trigger an upwards wall kick and move the O-piece into the O-shaped hole.

                <p>
                    Before the Tetris Guideline existed, Tetris games used a variety of rotation systems and game mechanics which aren't
                    seen in modern entries. Some of these allow for some very interesting techniques.

                    <h3>Tetris The Absolute The Grand Master 2 The RO Medal PLUS</h3>

                    <p>
                        Tetris The Grand Master 2 (TGM2) features six medals which can be achieved by performing a variety of tasks within a
                        single round. One of these medals is the RO (rotation) medal, achieved by maintaining an average of at least 6
                        rotations for every 5 pieces. If you do this, you will receive a bronze RO medal at level 300, a silver medal at
                        700, and a gold medal at 999.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All rotations for all pieces count towards this medal, making O-piece rotations very useful for acquiring and
                        upgrading it.

                    <h3>Tetris 64 and its Inexplicably Obscure Rotation System</h3>

                    <p>
                        By default, Tetris 64 uses Sega Rotation, which was originally made for Sega's arcade Tetris and is the rotation
                        system that was adapted for the TGM games. However, this game offers several options to alter how rotations work:
                    </p>
            
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Offset Turn: Enables wall kicks
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Double Turn: Enables limited 180-degree rotations, usable by double-tapping in a tight space
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rotate Center:
                            <span class="tooltip" title="YES AN ENTIRE ROTATION SYSTEM I AM NOT EXAGGERATING">
                                Enables an alternative, unique rotation system
                            </span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <p>
                        Yeah, this game just casually drops an entire rotation system that is unique to Tetris 64 and intentionally permits
                        O-spins via wall kicks in the second page of the options menu. No wonder this slipped under most of the Tetris
                        community's radar!
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        Anyway, Rotate Center activates what I call the Tetris 64 Rotation System, as it's not known to be used in any other
                        Tetris game. This rotation system defines four distinct rotation states for every piece, including the O-piece.
                        Because of this, the O-piece actually moves when rotated. When combined with Offset Turn and/or Double Turn, this
                        can be used to execute genuine, developer-intended O-spins.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any information about how this rotation system and its wall kicks actually
                        work, and discussions about the unusual spins this game permits are limited. I guess this is all I can say about
                        Tetris 64, then-
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        So I decided to experiment with the game and document the entire Tetris 64 rotation system myself, specifically for
                        a <span class="tooltip" title="If you couldn't tell by now, yes I am autistic">guide about O-piece rotations</span>.
                        Well, only the tetrominoes. There's a Bio Tetris mode which can spawn anything from monominoes to pentominoes based
                        on your heart rate, but those were outside the scope of my research.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        <img src="files/t64_opiece_offset.png" alt="Tetris 64 O-Piece Offset Table" />

                        Here is an offset table for the O-piece. The orientations are in the middle, with basic rotations on either side.
                        Then, each rotation has two possible wall kicks, one for each direction. The left kick will always be
                        <span class="tooltip" title="Fun Fact: this game has Mihara's Conspiracy but mirrored">prioritised</span>
                        over the right kick if both would succeed.

                    <h3>Audio Cues</h3>

                    <p>
                        To end the non-guideline section, I'd like to look at another fun use for O-piece rotations that will be impractical
                        for most people. However, if you like beating scores in blindfolded categories, this may still be useful for you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Compared to more recent entries, older Tetris games use very primitive rotation systems. This section will likely
                        apply to any Tetris game with rotation SFX and no wall kicks, but I'll use Nintendo Rotation System (NRS), as seen
                        in NES and Game Boy Tetris, to illustrate audio cues. The rotation SFX and lack of wall kicks in these games can be
                        used while blindfolded to determine what your active piece is, at least to some extent.
                    </p>

                    <p>The following steps can be applied in NES Tetris:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Perform a 0L rotation, DAS to the left wall, then attempt an L0 rotation. If the L0 rotation succeeds, there is
                            a 100% chance you have an O-piece. Yay!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the L0 rotation fails, move one column to the right and try again. If this still fails, there is a 100%
                            chance you have an I-piece.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the second L0 rotation succeeds, perform a 0R rotation (this will always succeed), then attempt to move the
                            piece 1 column to the left. If this movement succeeds, then there is a 50% chance you have an S-piece and a 50%
                            chance you have a Z-piece.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the movement fails, there is a 33% chance you have a J-piece, a 33% chance you have an L-piece, and a 33%
                            chance you have a T-piece.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Unfortunately, I don't yet know of any ways to distinguish S/Z and J/L/T. If you do, please let me know!
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        GB Tetris instead uses a mirrored, "left-handed" version of NRS, but the above still applies if all movements and
                        rotations are mirrored. Beware its 18-height playfield, which will give you less time to determine your piece.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While it's
                        <span class="tooltip" title="I eagerly wait for the Classic Tetris community to prove me wrong">not possible</span>
                        to play indefinitely without exceptional luck, the above steps can theoretically be used to clear a decent amount of
                        lines before topping out.

                <h2>Tetris-like Stackers</h2>

                <p>
                    Outside of the Tetris series is an entire genre inspired by it. These games, as well as Tetris, are known as stackers.
                    As they are not bound by the Tetris Guideline, these stackers can be much more creative with how pieces behave and
                    interact with each other, introducing a variety of new game mechanics that can set them apart from Tetris. Many stackers
                    implement custom rotation systems which introduce unique ways to rotate O-pieces and execute O-spins.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Unless otherwise specified, the techniques described for each game are performed with that game's default rotation
                    system. Many community-made stacker games allow the selection of rotation systems from other games, which would permit
                    the use of those games' O-piece rotation techniques. However, describing them in each game that uses them would result
                    in far too much repetition.
                </p>

                <section id="ascension">
                    <h3>Ascension and its Extensive Wall Kicks</h3>

                    <p>
                        While Ascension (ASC) features highly customisable pieces which allow you to play with any type of polymino that can
                        fit in a 5x5 grid, I'll be describing things based on the default tetromino set. With that said, this game's O-Spin
                        techniques should be generally applicable to any custom O-piece regardless of where you put its centre block as all
                        pieces use the same offset table.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        ASC uses an offset table which defines a massive 21 wall kicks for when basic rotation fails. In addition, because
                        pieces are defined in a 5x5 area, the O-piece will always have a centre which allows it to move on rotation.

                    <p>
                        Nuketris mostly uses SRS, but with some modifications to allow O-spins. The O-piece will rotate around its "centre"
                        block without the SRS offset applied to it, and uses the same offset table as the rest of the pieces (except for the
                        I-piece). The centre block of the O-piece starts in the bottom-right corner in most modes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nuketris also features a unique mode called Worm, which involves navigating an O-piece through an infinite tunnel
                        which ascends at increasing speeds using O-Spins and your knowledge of wall kicks. You must survive for as long as
                        possible without topping out due to your O-piece being pushed above the ceiling. In this mode, the centre block of
                        the O-piece is highlighted, and starts in the top-left instead of the bottom-right.

                    <h3>Techmino and Transformative O-Spins</h3>

                    <p>
                        Techmino Rotation System (TRS) functions mostly like SRS, but with a few exceptions. It just so happens that one of
                        these exceptions is how O-pieces behave when you perform very specific rotations in certain situations - it
                        transforms into other pieces and can be used to execute spins which the game registers as O-Spins.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Transformative O-Spins can be performed by moving an O-piece somewhere you would normally perform a spin with a
                        different piece, then performing the relevant rotation sequence from the list below. Note that "F" is short for
                        "Flip" and refers to the game's 180-degree rotation button.
                    </p>

                    <h3>TETR.IO and All-Spin</h3>

                    <p>
                        While TETR.IO does implement O-Spin recognition, O-piece rotations don't really have any practical use (aside from
                        the previously mentioned stalling techniques) with the game's default rotation system, SRS+. However, there are a
                        few fun things you can do with them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        TETR.IO offers several options for spin recognition, such as:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>T-Spins: Only recognises T-Spins as spins</li>
                        <li>All-Spin: Recognises spins for all pieces</li>
                        <li>Stupid: Recognises every floor rotation as a "spin"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Of course, setting the allowed spins to "Stupid" will allow you to O-Spin with every O-piece, but it's clear that
                        this is just a novelty feature and it makes it feel a bit too easy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        O-Spins can still be executed when allowed spins is set to "All-Spin", though it's still very impractical. This was
                        probably intended for use with the game's other rotation system options based on other stacker games, but it can
                        actually be executed in SRS, too. If an O-shaped hole is pushed up to the exact location where the O-piece spawns,
                        or if a custom map is created where such a hole already exists, rotating the piece there will register as an O-Spin.
                    </p>

                <h2>Random Ramblings</h2>

                <p>
                    This isn't really part of the guide, but I like rambling. Maybe you'll find some of it interesting.

                    You may wonder why I always say "Tetris games" and "Tetris-like stackers", instead of "versions of Tetris". I don't like
                    the latter because it implies the Tetris series is just the same game with minor visual differences, and that other
                    stacker games are just knock-offs of Tetris that don't add anything to the gameplay. I've played a lot of stackers, and
                    I assure you they all feel very different to play at anything higher than a casual level, even if they have to adhere to
                    the Tetris Guideline.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    As for "Tetris-like stackers", this is because the community often uses Tetris to describe the entire stacker genre.
                    Their fundamental mechanics may look and feel similar to Tetris, but they are not entries in the Tetris series. Many of
                    them are respected by the Tetris community as games in their own right.

                    Tetris Effect is not a rhythm game. Rather, you are a rhythm game which Tetris Effect plays perfectly. Tetris Effect has
                    exactly one rhythm-based game mechanic and it requires you to be dead in Connected mode to utilise it.
                </p>

                    My mind is blown by the fact Tetris 64's rotation system exists and it's shocking to me how so few people know about it.
                    With techniques only seen in Tetris-like stacker games to this day, Tetris 64 was years ahead of its time.

                    I like purple a normal amount, as I'm sure you can tell.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    I often wonder, how many mainline Tetris games are there, and which ones count as mainline?
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    If you ever think you're useless, know that there's a huge guide about how to rotate the square in Tetris. No matter
                    what you may think about yourself, you are good for something even if you don't know it yet. I hope you can find it one
                    day.
