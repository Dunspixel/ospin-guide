                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                    To a casual Tetris player, rotating the <span class="tooltip" title="The square piece">O-piece</span> appears to be completely useless. It's the only piece which does not move when you rotate it, and its identical rotation states typically prevent it from interacting with walls or other pieces. But what if there were actually ways to use these seemingly useless rotations to your advantage? As it turns out, many Tetris games and stackers based on the series do actually implement game mechanics which make it useful to rotate the O-piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My name is Dunspixel (she/they). I love playing a variety of stacker games and learning about the mechanical differences between each one. I also have a very strong opinion about O-piece rotations and way too much free time, so I decided to make this guide describing every known use for rotating the O-piece in these games.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rotating the O-piece may be nothing more than a meme to some, but many of the techniques in this guide really are practical and some can be utilised at all skill levels. However, I'm still going to include a variety of useless and whimsical techniques too, simply because they're fun. Useful or otherwise, I hope I can help you appreciate O-piece rotations for what they can really do.

                <h2>Chapter 1: General Concepts</h2>

                <p>
                    Before we begin, I'd like to discuss some concepts that will be useful to understand the techniques in this guide, then go on a brief rant about the semantics of the terms many people use to describe stacker games. If you don't care about that and just want to know some uses for O-piece rotations, you may want to skip to Chapter 2.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will use some conventions throughout the guide to highlight important information, which will be written in colour-coded text:
                </p>

                    <li><span class="nostate">Blue - state-agnostic rotations</span></li>

            <section id="rotation">
                <h3>Rotation</h3>

                <p>
                    When you press a rotation button, your active piece will rotate by 90 degrees in the chosen direction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ok, obvious statements aside, there's actually a lot more going on than most people give it credit for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A piece can be in one of four rotation states. In this guide, I will describe rotation states using "<span class="state">0R2L</span>" <span class="tooltip" title="Yes I did this on purpose you can't stop me">rotation notation</span>, in which pieces spawn in state <span class="state">0</span>, and rotating right (clockwise) changes to <span class="state">R</span>, <span class="state">2</span>, <span class="state">L</span>, then back to <span class="state">0</span>. Likewise, rotating left (anti-clockwise or counter-clockwise) from state <span class="state">0</span> will cycle through states <span class="state">L</span>, <span class="state">2</span>, <span class="state">R</span>, and <span class="state">0</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will describe state-dependent rotations (i.e. those where the rotation state is relevant) as combinations of the above rotation states, with an arrow to indicate direction. For example:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A clockwise rotation from <span class="state">0</span> to <span class="state">R</span> is <span class="state">0R&gt;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An anti-clockwise rotation from <span class="state">0</span> to <span class="state">L</span> is <span class="state">&lt;0L</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A clockwise 180-degree rotation from <span class="state">0</span> to <span class="state">2</span> is <span class="state">0R2&gt;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A single button 180-degree rotation from <span class="state">0</span> to <span class="state">2</span> is <span class="state">&lt;02&gt;</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You may be wondering how a <span class="state">0R2&gt;</span> rotation differs from a <span class="state">&lt;02&gt;</span> rotation. There's actually one game in this guide that implements 180-degree rotations like those featured in the Puyo Puyo series, where you can flip a piece by quickly double-tapping a rotation button in a tight space. Rotations like these technically work differently from 180-degree rotations triggered by a single button press, hence the different notation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    State-agnostic rotations (i.e. those where the rotation state doesn't matter) will be written in one of two ways. The longer notation will be used for rotations on their own, while the shorter notation will be used for sequences.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Counter-Clockwise - <span class="nostate">CCW</span> or <span class="nostate">L</span></li>
                    <li>Clockwise - <span class="nostate">CW</span> or <span class="nostate">R</span></li>
                    <li>180 - <span class="nostate">180</span> or <span class="nostate">F</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In many stackers (especially modern Tetris games), the O-piece can have multiple rotation states even if each one is identical. This means the O-piece is actually rotating internally even if there is no visual feedback for doing so. In the Tetris Worlds implementation of the commonly used Super Rotation System, or <span class="system">SRS</span> for short, the O-piece internally rotates around one of its blocks (the lower-left block in state <span class="state">0</span>), but an offset is applied to keep it in place when rotated. This may or may not be the case for implementations in other games, though.

                <h3>Wall Kicks</h3>

                <p>
                    Wall kicks are a feature of many modern rotation systems, which allow pieces to move when rotated if their new position is obstructed by a wall or another piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In <span class="system">SRS</span>, four alternative positions are checked if basic rotation fails, and the piece will move to the first one that succeeds. For example, this is how the infamous Fin TSD works in <span class="system">SRS</span>:

                    Different rotation systems can handle wall kicks by defining a different offset table, or instead try to kick by rotating around an alternate centre. Regardless of implementation, they're super fun to use once you know how they work!

                <h3>Wiki Links</h3>

                <p>
                    You may have noticed that I provide two very similar wiki links for many of the sections in this guide. Hard Drop and TetrisWiki are both fantastic community resources for information about Tetris games, but many of the pages have very similar content due to being forked from the now-defunct Tetrisconcept wiki, and editors adding content to both wikis at the same time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Which one you pick is really down to personal preference, though if there's something you can't find on one wiki, you will probably be able to find it on the other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even though past proposals to merge the wikis have been rejected, the Tetris community generally agrees that both of them are <strong>significantly</strong> better than the Fandom wiki, which I recommend you avoid.
                </p>

                <h3>"Versions of Tetris"?</h3>

                <p>
                    So this section is that rant about semantics I mentioned earlier, which you'll hopefully find somewhat educational and/or entertaining. I'd love to know what other people think about this topic!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also, I hope this rant doesn't come across as too negative or angry. I'm not mad at any of you, I promise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Am I the only one who is bothered by different Tetris games, and stackers in general, being referred to as "versions of Tetris"? It's a term which perpetuates the myth that the Tetris series is literally just the same game ported to pretty much every device imaginable, and that Tetris-like stackers are just knock-offs of what they perceive to be the "real thing".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sure, the original Tetris was the first stacker game. It did indeed start the genre of puzzle games which many people in the Tetris community name after it. But to say that they're all just the exact same game is plainly wrong.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This isn't helped at all by the fact that even The Tetris Company, who licenses the Tetris series, refers to their own games as "versions" of the same game instead of what they are: entries in a series.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Don't get me started on the whole "it's just Tetris" thing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While all (tetromino-based) stacker games may superficially look identical to each other, they all feel very different to play at anything higher than a casual level. This is even true of modern Tetris games which have to adhere to the Tetris Guideline. Some examples of differences which drastically affect gameplay include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game modes</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Rotation systems</strong></li>
                    <li>Piece randomisers</li>
                    <li>Available drop types (soft, hard, sonic)</li>
                    <li>Hold mechanics</li>
                    <li>Spin recognition</li>
                    <li>Lock delay (or lack of it)</li>
                    <li>Timings (e.g. DAS and ARR)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    To clear up some terms related to stacker games, this is how I use them in this guide:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stacker / Stacker Game</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A genre of puzzle games in which you place pieces (typically tetrominoes) and clear horizontal lines by completing them
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Includes the Tetris series and all Tetris-like stackers
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                May use pieces other than tetrominoes or feature non-tetromino modes (outside the scope of this guide)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Another name for this genre is "falling block puzzle"
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tetris Community</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The general community of people who love stacker games
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <em>Includes</em> stackers outside of the Tetris series
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The name is likely because the community often uses "Tetris" to refer to the entire genre
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>

                            <li>
                                Most are distinct from each other

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A stacker game whose gameplay is largely based on Tetris, but is not a part of the Tetris series
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Being a "Tetris game" and being a "Tetris-like stacker" are mutually exclusive
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Known in the Tetris community as "unofficial games" or "fan games"

                            <li>
                                Again, most are distinct from each other (and also from Tetris)

                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Version</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A game ported to another platform with few or no changes
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The PS4 and Switch releases of Tetris Effect are versions of Tetris Effect, but Tetris Effect is not just a version of Tetris
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h2>Chapter 2: Guideline Tetris</h2>

                <p>
                    The Tetris Guideline is a document which developers of Tetris games follow to ensure each game has some degree of mechanical consistency. The first Tetris game to follow the Tetris Guideline, at least in the form which evolved into what we know today, is Tetris Worlds from 2001. Almost every Tetris game released since then has adhered to some version of this guideline, hence why modern Tetris games are often referred to as "Guideline Tetris".
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most important feature of the Tetris Guideline is the aforementioned <span class="system">SRS</span>, which it introduced to the Tetris series. We'll encounter a lot of rotation systems in this guide, but <span class="system">SRS</span> is by far the one you'll see the most both in modern Tetris games and in Tetris-like stackers.

                <h3>Move-Reset Lock Delay</h3>

                <p>
                    Finally! I get to talk about an actual use for O-piece rotations! This one is by far the most practical O-piece rotation technique you can use in the Tetris series at any skill level. If you only learn one thing from this guide, let it be this.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Many Tetris games, including all guideline games, implement a lock delay. This means when the active piece reaches the bottom of the board or the top of the stack, the game provides a brief window of time (typically 30 frames or half a second) to move or rotate the piece before it locks into place.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Move-Reset Lock Delay, as implemented in most guideline Tetris games, resets whenever the active piece is moved or rotated. Earlier guideline games such as Tetris Worlds and Tetris DS allow you to do this indefinitely, while later games impose a limit of 15 resets per step. This means once your active piece reaches a floor, it can be moved or rotated up to 15 times before it is forced to lock, with these 15 resets replenishing when the piece moves down due to gravity or soft drop. A staircase-like formation can be used to maximise the number of resets you can do with a single piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Repeatedly resetting the lock delay just before the piece locks is called "stalling". This is a versatile technique which is useful at a variety of skill levels, especially in multiplayer battles. Some examples include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Giving yourself extra time to decide where to place a piece
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delaying a line clear in battle to block or mitigate an incoming attack that would cause you to top out
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delaying a <span class="tooltip" title="piecement places">piece placement</span> to receive garbage lines from an imminent attack, then using this garbage for a counterspike
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If your active piece is an O-piece, then all of this can be achieved by rotating it while it's on the floor. In tight areas, many pieces can wall kick to unexpected places when rotated, especially if you're less familiar with <span class="system">SRS</span>. Because the O-piece does not move on rotation in guideline Tetris games, it is the easiest and safest piece to use when stalling.

                <h3>Tetris Effect and Initial Rotation</h3>

                <p>
                    Tetris Effect features two major mechanics which make O-piece rotations especially useful when used together:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Zone, which stops time and allows you to perform massive line clears
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Initial Rotation System (IRS), which allows you to spawn pieces in a pre-rotated state
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Note that IRS is a setting in the options menu that is turned off by default. You will need to set it to Type-A for it to be able to prevent top-outs in tight spaces.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Tetris Effect, all pieces spawn with their lowest block on row 20. When your stack is at the top of your board, you have limited space to spawn and manoeuvre pieces without topping out. To prevent topping out, hold a rotation button on your active piece while placing it, which will activate IRS and spawn the next piece rotated in that direction. This will cause the spawned piece to span fewer columns and is particularly useful for two types of situation:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Surviving poor board states and/or a large number of garbage lines, allowing you to downstack</li>
                    <li>Using Zone to clear 20 <span class="tooltip" title="kirb your ultimatris">or more</span> lines at once</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    With most pieces, if your active piece is already in the desired rotation state and you are not already holding the appropriate rotation button, you will need to initialise the next piece's spawn state by performing a rotation in the opposite direction to the desired spawn state, then rotate it back while keeping the rotation button held down. This will then allow you drop the piece and spawn the next piece in its desired state.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because the O-piece has identical rotation states, you do not need to consider its current rotation state when placing it. Even if you are not currently holding a rotation button, you only need to perform a single rotation in the direction of the next piece's desired spawn state, which makes the O-piece the easiest piece to use with IRS.
                </p>

                <h3>Puyo Puyo Tetris and Stack Overlap "O-Spins"</h3>

                <p>
                    This is much more whimsical than the other uses in this chapter, having pretty much zero practical use. However, seeing an O-piece wall kick in a modern guideline Tetris game and the ridiculous setup it requires is absolutely hilarious and I love it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Puyo Puyo Tetris implements a slightly altered <span class="system">SRS</span> offset table which defines wall kicks for the O-piece. This is because of the P pentomino used in the game's Party mode, which the O-piece derives an offset table from.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Triggering this wall kick for the standard O-piece is much tricker, and requires you to exploit situations where your active piece overlaps with your stack without topping you out. There are two ways of doing this:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Take an O-piece out of hold in a situation where it would overlap with your stack - this won't top you out until the piece locks due to a PPT-specific bug
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In Fusion mode, use an O-piece to slowly break through a stack of Puyos into a double line clear and place another O-piece underneath a part of your stack before the line clear moves your stack into your O-piece
                    </li>
                </ul>
                    
                <p>
                    Fusion mode combines Puyo Puyo with Tetris on the same board, introducing some unusual behaviour when Puyos and Tetris pieces interact with each other. By soft dropping a piece on top of a Puyo stack, the Tetris piece will slowly break through the stack, and activate the next piece which you can use at the same time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a complex setup in Fusion mode which allows you to exploit this behaviour and execute an O-spin:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A Tetris stack with a two wide, minimum four high well</li>
                    <li>Puyos filling the well in this stack</li>
                    <li>An overhang above the well, with enough space to the side and underneath to fit an O-piece</li>
                    <li>A fully enclosed O-shaped hole inside this overhang, with the floor being one block high</li>
                    <li>Access to two consecutive O-pieces via the next and/or hold queues</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    First, slide the first O-piece under the overhang and allow it to lock on top of the puyo stack. Once it locks, it will slowly break through the puyo stack.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the second O-piece spawns (or you take it out of hold), perform a <span class="state">0R&gt;</span> rotation. You can then use the time spent by the first piece breaking through the puyo stack to move the second O-piece to the same place. You'll want to time it so the first piece reaches the bottom and clears the lines before the second piece is affected by gravity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the lines are cleared, your second O-piece will be pushed into the ceiling (or the floor of the hole). When this happens, perform an <span class="state">&lt;R0</span> rotation and your O-piece will kick upwards, filling the hole and completing the O-Spin.
                </p>

                <h3>Tetris Stardust and Actual O-Spins</h3>

                <p>
                    Ok, maybe you're thinking that last section was a bit too silly. Perhaps you're looking for an O-Spin in a guideline Tetris game that is developer intended and doesn't require a ludicrous setup. You're probably also wondering if such a game really exists in the Tetris series. Good news, it does, and it's called Tetris Stardust!
                </p>

                <p>
                    To tell you the truth, I only recently learned this game existed, mainly because it's a game that was only released in Japan, made using Silverlight of all things, and there is very little information about it online. It's mostly based on Tetris Online, but with a few important differences. As you can probably tell by the existence of this section, some of these differences have something to do with how the O-piece behaves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tetris Stardust primarily uses <span class="system">SRS</span> just like any other guideline Tetris game, but there is a special case which allows the O-piece to wall kick. Unusually for a game with O-piece kicks, the O-piece doesn't actually move on normal rotation, nor does it have multiple distinct rotation states (though it does technically have four identical states). Instead, it checks the following conditions and bypasses basic rotation if the check succeeds:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If rotating left, the space directly underneath the <strong>lower-right</strong> block must be occupied.</li>
                    <li>If rotating right, the space directly underneath the <strong>lower-left</strong> block must be occupied.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If the check succeeds, the O-piece will then kick according to the offset chart below. To my knowledge, Tetris Stardust is the only Tetris game which actually acknowledges O-Spins by name, and also the only one to explicitly reward them.
                </p>

                <div class="centre">
                    <img src="img/stardust_opiece_offset.png" alt="Tetris Stardust O-Piece Offset Chart" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    This is about all I could figure out just by playing the game, considering how little it is documented. So I did what any curious and totally sane person would do in this situation, and ran the game through a decompiler. Good thing Silverlight apps are easy to decompile!
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to the points scored by O-Spins and their associated line clears, the act of performing these spins awards points based on a "Spin Rank" system unique to this game. There are a total of 10 Spin Ranks: E, D, C, B, A-, A, A+, S-, S, and S+. Any kick that would cause the Spin Rank to exceed S+ will simply award an S+.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Spin Rank is particularly useful because it awards points without clearing lines, and the aim of Tetris Stardust is to score as many points as possible in 40 lines.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Spin Rank is awarded for each kick which moves the piece below its previous lowest block. This means kicks which move the piece upwards or only move horizontally will not award Spin Rank. This also prevents you from gaining Spin Rank by repeatedly performing a kick, then the opposite kick to move it back to its previous position. Score for Spin Rank is awarded per wall kick, so performing multiple rank-eligible kicks with the same piece will award multiple score bonuses. For example, a C-Rank spin (200 points) followed by a B-Rank spin (400 points) performed with the same piece will award a total of 600 points, not just the 400 for the final spin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the O-Piece, Kick 1 does not award Spin Rank, Kick 2 has a base Spin Rank of C, and Kicks 3 and 4 have a base Spin Rank of A. Chaining multiple kicks together will increase Spin Rank based on the rank of the previous kick:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>E, D, C: +1</li>
                    <li>B, A-: +2</li>
                    <li>A, A+, S-: +3</li>
                    <li>S, S+: +4</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Here are some examples of chained spins and the ranks they award. All of these setups can be mirrored, though you will need to rotate in the opposite direction.

                <p>
                    A-Rank spins add a +3 bonus to following spins, so chaining two of them together increases the second spin to rank S. Following this, the S-Rank spin will add a +4 bonus to the next spin, so a third A-Rank spin will be increased to the maximum Spin Rank of S+. The total Spin Rank bonus for the first two spins is 2400, while the third increases the total to 4200. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The inner workings of Spin Rank are actually much more complicated than this. Even after spending some time reading this part of the game logic, hell if I can understand it. The spins with a base rank of A actually have an internal base rank of B, but there's a "rotation level" which triggers a thing which increases this B to A. I can't for the life of me figure out why this isn't also being applied to the C-Rank spins. Perhaps what I think are the C-Rank spins don't actually have a defined Spin Rank and they're defaulting to E (because E-Rank is 0 internally)?

                <h3>Useful Notes</h3>

                <p>
                    Some Guideline-era games actually implement <em>step-reset</em> lock delay instead of move-reset. This means the lock delay only resets when your active piece moves downwards due to gravity or soft-drop, much like how move-reset's reset count works. This prevents you from stalling by rotating a piece while it is on the floor and typically removes all utility for O-piece rotations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These games include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Tetris The Grand Master 3 (Classic Rule)
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This game does have IRS, with the first TGM game introducing it to the series, but unlike Tetris Effect, the TGM games only allow you to use IRS during piece entry delay. Buffering IRS with an O-piece rotation does not work here.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                World Rule uses move-reset lock delay, meaning O-piece rotations can be used to stall like in most Guideline games.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                To my knowledge, there is no use for rotating the O-piece in this particular game. I still love it, though.

                <p>
                    Before the Tetris Guideline existed, Tetris games used a variety of rotation systems and game mechanics which aren't seen in modern entries. Some of these allow for some very interesting techniques.

                <h3>Tetris The Absolute The Grand Master 2 The RO Medal PLUS</h3>

                <p>
                    Tetris The Grand Master 2 (TGM2) features six medals which can be achieved by performing a variety of tasks within a single round. One of these medals is the RO (rotation) medal, achieved by maintaining an average of at least 6 rotations for every 5 pieces. If you do this, you will receive a bronze RO medal at level 300, a silver medal at 700, and a gold medal at 999.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All rotations for all pieces count towards this medal, and it's actually possible to perform a rotation with the O-piece on every frame. Mashing the rotation buttons while an O-piece is active will make it much easier to obtain this medal.

                <h3>Tetris 64 and its Inexplicably Obscure Rotation System</h3>

                <p>
                    By default, Tetris 64 uses Sega Rotation, which was originally made for Sega Tetris (1988) and is the rotation system that was adapted for the TGM games. However, this game offers several options to alter how rotations work:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Offset Turn: Enables wall kicks
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Double Turn: Enables limited 180-degree rotations, usable by double-tapping in a tight space
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rotate Center:
                        <span class="tooltip" title="YES AN ENTIRE ROTATION SYSTEM I AM NOT EXAGGERATING">
                            Enables an alternative, unique rotation system
                        </span>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This game really just dropped an entire rotation system that is unique to Tetris 64 and intentionally permits O-Spins via wall kicks in the second page of the options menu. In 1998. And this slipped under most of the Tetris community's radar, largely due to it being overshadowed by the Bio Sensor that was included with the game. As cool as that is, it bugs me a little that it's commonly perceived as the only thing this game added to the series.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anyway, Rotate Center activates what I call the Tetris 64 Rotation System (<span class="system">T64</span>), as it's not known to be used in any other Tetris game. This rotation system defines four distinct rotation states for every piece, including the O-piece. Because of this, the O-piece actually moves when rotated. When combined with Offset Turn and/or Double Turn, this can be used to execute genuine, developer-intended O-Spins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While I could find some gameplay and a few discussions about this game's unusual spins, I unfortunately couldn't find any detailed information about how any of it actually works, such as the rotation states and the specifics of how the wall kicks work. I guess this is all I can say about Tetris 64, then-
                </p>

                <p>
                    So I decided to lab and document <span class="system">T64</span> (excluding the Bio Tetris polyminoes) myself, specifically for a guide about O-piece rotations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below is an offset chart for the O-piece in <span class="system">T64</span>. The rotation states are in the middle, with basic rotations on either side. Then, each rotation has two possible wall kicks, one for each direction. The block outlined in black is the rotation centre.
                </p>

                <div class="centre">
                    <img src="img/t64_opiece_offset.png" alt="Tetris 64 O-Piece Offset Chart" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    Fun Fact: While not relevant to the O-piece, the left kick will always be prioritised over the right kick if both would succeed. Because of the wall kick order, this game has a mirrored form of Mihara's Conspiracy, as seen in Arika Rotation System (<span class="system">ARS</span>).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below are a few (somewhat) practical O-Spin setups. Unfortunately, the kicks in <span class="system">T64</span> limit you to clearing O-Spin Singles. O-Spin Doubles are impossible as there are no wall kicks which move the piece downwards. Additionally, spins do not award any bonus points in Tetris 64. Their main utility is to fix misdrops and to plan around the game's random piece generator. Alternatively, they're great for flexing on your spectators as their jaws drop at your stylish O-piece placement skills.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Practical uses aside, one can have a lot of fun with O-Spins by making some silly setups. Even with such limited wall kicks, you can chain them together!
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, chaining O-Spins is tricky. Trying to do this like you can in some modern stackers won't work as there are no wall kicks that can move the O-piece vertically. Instead, you need to rely on the <span class="state">R</span> and <span class="state">2</span> rotation states being one row lower than the other two. This means repeating and following the above setups won't allow you to chain spins together as the rotation will either fail or cause the piece to move back to where it was before the first rotation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To get around this, you'll need to create a space above subsequent kick setups, allowing you to rotate the piece back into the <span class="state">0</span> or <span class="state">L</span> state before performing another wall kick.
                </p>

                    With enough chains, something like the setup below should be theoretically possible, allowing one to perform eight O-Spins before clearing an O-Spin Single. I'd love to see a TAS which creates and executes it.

                <h3>Sega Tetris (1999)</h3>

                <p>
                    Ah, the one game in this guide I haven't played yet. For the time being, there isn't much I can say about it. Sorry!
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this game's Battle mode, clearing a double will cause your opponent to join the piece you used for the line clear with their next piece. The attacking piece can then rotate around it. This feature can optionally be enabled in single player, allowing you to join the line clear piece to your next piece.
                </p>

                <h3>Audio Cues</h3>

                <p>
                    To end the non-guideline section, I'd like to look at another fun use for O-piece rotations that will be impractical for most people. However, if you like beating scores in blindfolded categories, this may still be useful for you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Compared to more recent entries, older Tetris games use very primitive rotation systems. This section will likely apply to any Tetris game with rotation SFX and no wall kicks, but I'll use Nintendo Rotation System (<span class="system">NRS</span>), as seen in NES and Game Boy Tetris, to illustrate audio cues. The rotation SFX and lack of wall kicks in these games can be used while blindfolded to determine what your active piece is, at least to some extent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The following steps can be applied in NES Tetris:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Perform a <span class="state">&lt;0L</span> rotation, DAS to the left wall, then attempt an <span class="state">L0&gt;</span> rotation. If the <span class="state">L0&gt;</span> rotation succeeds, there is a 100% chance you have an O-piece. Yay!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the <span class="state">L0&gt;</span> rotation fails, move one column to the right and try again. If this still fails, there is a 100% chance you have an I-piece.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the second <span class="state">L0&gt;</span> rotation succeeds, perform a <span class="state">0R&gt;</span> rotation (this will always succeed), then attempt to move the piece 1 column to the left. If this movement succeeds, then there is a 50% chance you have an S-piece and a 50% chance you have a Z-piece.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the movement fails, there is a 33% chance you have a J-piece, a 33% chance you have an L-piece, and a 33% chance you have a T-piece.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unfortunately, I don't yet know of any ways to distinguish S/Z and J/L/T. If you do, please let me know!
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    GB Tetris instead uses a mirrored, "left-handed" version of <span class="system">NRS</span>, but the above still applies if all movements and rotations are mirrored. Beware its 18-height playfield, which will give you less time to determine your piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While it's <span class="tooltip" title="I eagerly wait for the Classic Tetris community to prove me wrong">not possible</span> to play indefinitely without exceptional luck, the above steps can theoretically be used to clear a decent amount of lines before topping out.

                <h2>Chapter 4: Tetris-like Stackers</h2>

                <p>
                    Outside of the Tetris series is an entire genre inspired by it. As they are not bound by the Tetris Guideline, these stackers can be much more creative with how pieces behave and interact with each other, introducing a variety of new game mechanics that can set them apart from <span class="tooltip" title="Yes, they are distinct games within the same genre">Tetris</span>. Many stackers implement custom rotation systems, introducing unique ways to rotate O-pieces and execute O-spins among whatever new game mechanics they bring to the genre.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Unless otherwise specified, the techniques described for each game are performed with that game's default rotation system. Many community-made stacker games allow the selection of rotation systems from other games, which would permit the use of those games' O-piece rotation techniques. However, describing them in each game that uses them would result in far too much repetition.
                </p>

            <section id="asc">
                <h3>Ascension and its Extensive Wall Kicks</h3>

                <p>
                    While Ascension (ASC) features highly customisable pieces allowing you to play with any type of polymino that can fit in a 5x5 grid, I'll be describing things based on the default tetromino set. Also, I will use my text convention to distinguish the game (ASC) and its rotation system (<span class="system">ASC</span>).
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="system">ASC</span> uses an offset table which defines a massive 21 wall kicks for when basic rotation fails. These kicks can be combined with rotation movement to kick a piece up to three spaces downwards and/or in the opposite direction of rotation. The offset table follows this order:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Basic rotation is always checked first. It's easy to look at the offset table and think that a kick should work, but the natural movement of the O-piece will always take priority.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The offset table prioritises kicks in the "lower backward" corner - horizontal and downwards opposite the direction of rotation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, a forward kick and one space down from there is checked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, the first upward kick is checked. This will always succeed if reached.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I said before that <span class="system">ASC</span>'s offset table defines 21 kicks. However, only 11 of these are actually applicable to the O-piece, and even then, most rotations don't have access to all of them. This is because of the kicks that only move the piece one space in a particular direction. For any rotation, one of these kicks will move the piece to its original position and therefore always succeed. The last of these is kick 11, hence why anything after this is irrelevant to the O-piece.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="state">0R&gt;</span> and <span class="state">&lt;L2</span> rotations can access the full range of 11 kicks. These have the unique ability to floor warp and are by far the most useful rotations for executing O-Spins.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="state">R2&gt;</span> and <span class="state">&lt;2R</span> rotations can access 9 kicks. These have the unique ability to wall warp.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="state">2L&gt;</span> and <span class="state">&lt;R0</span> rotations can access 2 kicks and are mainly used to access states <span class="state">0</span> and <span class="state">L</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="state">L0&gt;</span> and <span class="state">&lt;0L</span> rotations can only access 1 kick, which will move it back to its previous position (but in a new state).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are 180-degree rotations, but they do not kick.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rotation will never completely fail and will always at least result in a state change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ASC conveniently highlights the rotation centre of your active piece. In state <span class="state">0</span>, this is the bottom-left block.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Despite these "limitations", there is still huge potential for O-Spins, making this an incredibly fun rotation system for an O-Spin enthusiast like me. Plus, the limitations made the addition of an offset chart for this section feasible! Look at that rotational symmetry!
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Here are some setups and common situations with the possible rotations that can execute the desired kick.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These diagonal kicks mostly work due to natural downward movement, with other rotations typically failing this kick either due to basic rotation or a lateral kick away from the wall.

                <p>
                    Now things get <strong>really</strong> fun. Combining wall kicks with rotation state movement allows you to warp through a floor on your stack if there's an O-shaped hole underneath. As this isn't reversible due to kick limitations, you can even chain them together by going back to the previous state and repeating the rotation. Also, no walls are required either side of your O-piece for these!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Walls, much like floors, are only a suggestion in <span class="system">ASC</span>. The first two of these kicks (only moving the piece horizontally) are actually reversible, and unlike floor warps they require cycling through four rotations in the same direction to chain together.

                <h3>Nuketris and Worm Mode</h3>

                <p>
                    Nuketris primarily uses the <span class="system">SRS-X</span> rotation system first used in Heboris Unofficial Expansion, and later Nullpomino. <span class="system">SRS-X</span> works exactly like <span class="system">SRS</span> when rotating 90 degrees, but it has an extensive 180-degree offset table that defines 11 wall kicks for each rotation (as opposed to the 4 wall kicks for the 90-degree rotations).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unlike the original <span class="system">SRS-X</span> however, the O-piece rotation states have been modified so it now has four distinct states. The O-piece starts with its rotation centre at the bottom-right block, and will move on rotation. It can then kick using the same offset table as the rest of the pieces, with the exception of the I-piece which uses its own table.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nuketris also features a unique mode called Worm, which involves navigating an O-piece through an infinite tunnel which ascends at increasing speeds using O-Spins and your knowledge of wall kicks. You must survive for as long as possible without topping out due to your O-piece being pushed above the ceiling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Needless to say, I love this mode!
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you have probably come to expect by now, here's an O-piece offset chart for Nuketris. The block outlined in black is the rotation centre, while the block highlighted in orange, diagonally opposite the rotation centre, shows how the rotation state is displayed in Worm mode.
                </p>

                <div class="centre">
                    <img src="img/nuketris_opiece_offset.png" alt="Nuketris O-Piece Offset Chart" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    There are some 90-degree kicks here that move the O-piece back to its original position. These kicks are guaranteed to succeed, so any kicks defined after them are completely inaccessible. <span class="state">0R&gt;</span>, <span class="state">&lt;R0</span>, <span class="state">2L&gt;</span>, and <span class="state">&lt;L2</span> rotations are only useful for changing the rotation state because of this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Worm mode, the tunnel is made out of three-column spaces inside a wall of garbage blocks. For each row, the space will move left or right by one column, ensuring there will always be enough space for the O-piece to move. Because of this tunnel generation rule, we can actually rule out a lot of the above wall kicks as being inaccessible in Worm mode (unless you kick the piece above the tunnel at the beginning for some reason). We can rule out kicks for the following reasons:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The rotation and kick only move the piece horizontally (will be blocked by the wall)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rotation and kick only move the piece one or two spaces downwards (will be blocked by the floor)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The kick moves the piece far enough horizontally that the tunnel will never reach the O-piece's destination, even if it continues in a single direction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The kick is defined after another kick that will always succeed
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Below is the same offset chart, but only showing the wall kicks relevant to Worm mode.

                </div>

                <p>
                    Each state and rotation has use cases that make them useful, though generally speaking, the <span class="state">0</span> and <span class="state">R</span> states have more desirable kicks. States can also be divided into pairs, as the <span class="state">0</span>/<span class="state">R</span> ("upper") and <span class="state">2</span>/<span class="state">L</span> ("lower") state pairs are effectively interchangeable due to the 90-degree rotations between them that switch states without moving the piece.

                <h3>Techmino and Transformative O-Spins</h3>

                <p>
                    Techmino Rotation System (<span class="system">TRS</span>) functions mostly like <span class="system">SRS</span>, but with several changed/added wall kicks and new mechanics. One of these mechanics is how O-pieces behave when you perform very specific rotation sequences in certain situations - it transforms into other pieces and can be used to execute spins which the game registers as O-Spins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Transformative O-Spins can be performed by moving an O-piece somewhere you would normally perform a spin with a different piece, then performing the relevant rotation sequence from the list below. Note that <span class="nostate">F</span> is short for "Flip" and refers to the game's 180-degree rotation button.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>T: <span class="nostate">LLL</span>, <span class="nostate">RRR</span></li>
                    <li>Z: <span class="nostate">LRL</span>, <span class="nostate">RLR</span></li>
                    <li>S: <span class="nostate">RLR</span>, <span class="nostate">LRL</span></li>
                    <li>J: <span class="nostate">LLR</span>, <span class="nostate">RRL</span> (depending on spin)</li>
                    <li>L: <span class="nostate">RRL</span>, <span class="nostate">LLR</span> (depending on spin)</li>
                    <li>I: <span class="nostate">FFF</span></li>
                    <li>
                        O: <span class="nostate">RFR</span>, <span class="nostate">RRF</span>, <span class="nostate">RFF</span>, <span class="nostate">LFL</span>, <span class="nostate">LLF</span>, <span class="nostate">LFF</span> (depending on kick)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Specifically, this performs an "immovable" check on the O-piece (can the O-piece move down, left, or right) and the piece it is transforming into (can the new piece move in any direction). An exception to this is the I-piece, which only checks whether it is <em>vertically</em> immovable. If both of the checks see that the piece cannot move after the rotation sequence is entered, the piece will transform.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Interestingly, the T transformations are defined slightly differently for <span class="nostate">LLL</span> and <span class="nostate">RRR</span> - the "T-Spin Mini" transformations only work when rotating in a specific direction. This is also true for the J and L pieces, whose different spin sequences have completely different use cases. As a general rule, the final rotation in the sequence is the rotation you would normally perform with the piece being transformed into.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each sequence for the S and Z pieces can access the same three transformations for each piece. If the O-piece is in a situation where it can transform into both, <span class="nostate">LRL</span> will prioritise the Z transformation and <span class="nostate">RLR</span> will prioritise the S transformation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once an O-piece is transformed, it will rotate and kick exactly like the piece it transformed into. You can also hold it and use it later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After figuring out the code and testing each offset in the O-Spin offset table, these are all of the setups permitted by the in the order they are defined. Blocks coloured like the other pieces are for illustration purposes only - they show where the O-piece will kick to.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fun Fact: Because the "T-Spin Mini" spins don't require a two-high wall opposite the overhang, the O-piece is actually slightly better at T-Spin Triples in this scenario than the actual T-piece. However, the T-piece can be used when there is no wall here while the O-piece cannot. This is also true of J and L-Spin Triples!
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are also some translational O-Spins, triggered by different rotation sequences. These do not appear to transform the O-piece, though from what I can see they do technically transform the O-piece into itself. If it does though, it's a distinction without a difference.

                <h3>TETR.IO and All-Spin</h3>

                <p>
                    While TETR.IO does implement O-Spin recognition, O-piece rotations don't really have any practical use (aside from the previously mentioned stalling techniques) with the game's default rotation system, <span class="system">SRS+</span>. However, there are a few fun things you can do with them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    TETR.IO offers several options for spin recognition, such as:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>T-Spins: Only recognises T-Spins as spins</li>
                    <li>All-Spin: Recognises spins for all pieces</li>
                    <li>All-Mini: Like All-Spin, but spins other than T register as Mini spins</li>
                    <li>Stupid: Recognises every floor rotation as a "spin"</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Of course, setting the allowed spins to "Stupid" will allow you to O-Spin with every O-piece, but it's clear that this is just a novelty feature and it makes it feel a bit too easy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Singleplayer modes use T-Spins by default (though this can be changed in Custom Games), while the new multiplayer mode Zenith Tower and the upcoming Season 2 of Tetra League use All-Mini by default. In Zenith Tower specifically, activating The Magician will enable full All-Spin at the cost of punishing duplicate consecutive line clears.
                </p>

                <p>
                    O-Spins can still be executed when allowed spins is set to All-Spin or All-Mini, though it's still very impractical. This was probably intended for use with the game's other rotation system options, but it can actually be executed in <span class="system">SRS+</span>, too. If an O-shaped hole is pushed up to the exact location where the O-piece spawns, rotating the piece there will register as an O-Spin. Note that the O-piece will spawn on rows 22 and 23.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Normally, because the O-shaped hole requires blocks to be placed above it, performing an O-Spin by pushing the hole up with garbage lines will cause the top of the hole to overlap with your next piece and top you out. However, the hole does not need to be completely surrounded; the O-piece only needs to be immobile to register an O-Spin on rotation. Because of this, there is a specific setup which will allow you to survive and downstack by putting an S-shaped hole on top of the O-shaped hole:

                <p>
                    With the release of the new Zenith Tower mode, I noticed there's a random condition in Duo Mode requiring you to clear a Double with an O-piece to revive your partner if they're dead. Naturally, this has me wondering: Does performing a O-Spin Double with the above method satisfy this condition, revive your partner, and save your run even if it's sacrificial?

                <p>
                    This game's beta just released! Aquamino features a new rotation system called Aqua Rotation System (<span class="system">AqRS</span>), which has a unique O-piece rotation mechanic that compresses your stack to fill holes!
                </p>

                <p>
                    For now, I don't know nearly enough to write a proper guide about it, but I look forward to researching this game and its rotation system.

                <h3>Jstris and O-Spin Memes</h3>

                <p>
                    This one is very silly, even being described by the game's guide as a "meme rotation system". Fortunately, I'm a very silly person who considers it to be in the scope of this guide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jstris features a config option called "Blocks" which defines the piece set and rotation system. One of these options is "O-Spin", which has two distinct features. First, it vastly broadens the offset table so that each piece can utilise 16 wall kicks instead of the 4 possible in <span class="system">SRS</span> (the default in Jstris). Second, it permits two absolutely ridiculous O-Spins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first O-Spin (an O-Spin Triple) is performed by creating a T-Spin Triple setup where the T is "pointing" to the right. When the O-piece is placed next to the overhang, a <span class="nostate">CW</span> rotation will transform it into an L-piece. A second <span class="nostate">CW</span> rotation will transform it into a T-piece and fill the T-shaped hole, though this is still an "O-Spin" in a similar vein to Techmino's transformations.
                </p>

                    The second O-Spin (an O-Spin Quadruple) is performed by creating a 4x4 space with a 2x2 space touching its top-left or top-right corner. Placing an O-piece in the 2x2 space and performing a <span class="nostate">CCW</span> rotation (regardless of which direction the larger space is) will transform it into a 4x4 O-piece and kick it to the larger space. Following this, a <span class="nostate">CW</span> rotation will revert it to its original 2x2 form, and this can be repeated if there are other 4x4 spaces to kick into.
                </p>

                <h2>Chapter 5: Closing Thoughts</h2>

                <p>
                    With that, I hope I was able to teach you how O-piece rotations can be useful or otherwise fun, and that I have helped you learn to love them for what they can do. The stacker genre is far more complex than most players give it credit for and I love to see even the most obscure minutia about these games being shared.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Working on this project actually got me into researching Tetris games and their mechanics. Even though I had only set out to learn everything I can about O-piece rotations, I found myself learning about games I didn't know existed, and finding out previously undocumented information about a variety of Tetris games, related to this guide or otherwise. In some cases, I even tried some reverse engineering to see how these games actually work, with varying degrees of success. I look forward to seeing how much deeper this rabbit hole is in the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you to everyone whose work I have linked in this guide! Every guide and demonstration from the Tetris community and the communities of each stacker game has been incredibly useful to me, and every stacker game featured in Chapter 4 has provided many hours of enjoyment and wonder.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd also like to thank everyone who has taken the time to read my guide, and especially those of you who have helped me improve it! If you love to rotate the O-piece, you should know that you're really cool!

                    In some sections, I presented questions I don't know the answer to. I figured it would be a good idea to put them all in one place here:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How is the initial Spin Rank of a wall kick actually determined in Tetris Stardust?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can S/Z and J/L/T be distinguished while blindfolded in NES Tetris?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can performing an O-Spin Double in TETR.IO's Zenith Tower revive your partner if the last remaining revive condition is to clear a Double with an O-piece? If this kills you, is it registered before your partner is revived?

                    I'd be happy to talk about O-piece rotations, O-Spins, and wacky Tetris mechanics in general. However, please be aware that I'm very shy and socially awkward. I'll do my best to be nice.

                <h2>Random Ramblings</h2>

                <p>
                    This isn't really part of the guide, but I like rambling. Maybe you'll find some of it interesting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tetris Effect is not a rhythm game. Rather, you are a rhythm game which Tetris Effect plays perfectly. Tetris Effect has exactly one rhythm-based game mechanic and it requires you to be dead in Connected mode to utilise it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My main in Puyo Puyo (and the PPT games) is Draco, who seems to be a popular choice in this part of the community for some reason. Perhaps slightly less predictably, my second favourite character is Ally, who I share my actual name with. Unfortunately, I'm shockingly bad at Puyo.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My mind is blown by the fact Tetris 64's rotation system exists and it's shocking to me how so few people know about it. With techniques only seen in Tetris-like stacker games to this day, Tetris 64 was years ahead of its time. Tetris Stardust is even more mind-blowing, but its obscurity is much less surprising.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I wish the O-Spins and Spin Rank mechanics from Tetris Stardust could return in a new Tetris game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What's your favourite O-piece rotation? Mine's the O-Fin from Techmino! You can perform this by transforming an O-piece into a T-piece, then clearing a Fin TSD with it. It registers as an O-Spin Double!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd love to see or even create a rotation system where you can fin every piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What if there was a stacker that lets you pick a rotation system loadout and swap them out on the fly while playing? I can see a mechanic like that adding a great deal of depth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I often wonder, how many mainline Tetris games are there, and which ones count as mainline?
                </p>

                <p>
                    I like purple a normal amount, as I'm sure you can tell.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm not the only one who noticed this niche of weird and obscure mechanics in the Tetris community has a disproportionately large number of trans people, right? As a trans person myself, I wonder what it is that draws us to them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This guide is the most <span class="tooltip" title="shocking revelation">autistic</span> thing I've ever written. As of writing I have spent about three months studying O-piece rotations and writing about them. May this hyperfixation continue to bring me dopamine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you ever think you're useless, know that there's a huge guide about how to rotate the square in Tetris. No matter what you may think about yourself, you are good for something even if you don't know it yet. I hope you can find it one day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    No O-Spins for transphobes. Transphobes are exempt from the above sentiment and are in fact just useless.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you just scrolled all the way to the bottom, you're reading the Random Ramblings section! The actual guide is structured better than this!
