					<h1>How To Rotate Your O-Piece</h1>
			
					<p>
						A comprehensive guide to the practical and whimsical applications of O-piece rotations in the Tetris series and
						Tetris-like stackers
					</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>
					To a casual Tetris player, rotating the <span class="tooltip" title="The square piece">O-piece</span> appears to be
					completely useless. It's the only piece which does not move when you rotate it, and its identical rotation states
					typically prevent it from interacting with walls or other pieces. But what if there were actually ways to use these
					seemingly useless rotations to your advantage? As it turns out, many Tetris games and stackers based on the series do
					actually implement game mechanics which make it useful to rotate the O-piece.
				</p>

				<p>
					My name is Dunspixel (she/they). I love playing a variety of stacker games and learning about the mechanical
					differences between each one. I also have a very strong opinion about O-piece rotations and way too much free time, so
					I decided to make this guide describing every known use for rotating the O-piece in these games.
				</p>

				<p>
					Rotating the O-piece may be nothing more than a meme to some, but many of the techniques in this guide really are
					practical and some can be utilised at all skill levels. However, I'm still going to include a variety of useless and
					whimsical techniques too, simply because they're fun. Useful or otherwise, I hope I can help you appreciate O-piece
					rotations for what they can really do.
