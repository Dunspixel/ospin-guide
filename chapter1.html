				<h3>How To Rotate Your O-Piece</h3>
				<h2>Chapter 1: General Concepts</h2>

                <p>
                    Before we begin, I'd like to discuss some concepts that will be useful to understand the techniques in this guide, then
					go on a brief rant about the semantics of the terms many people use to describe stacker games. If you don't care about
					that and just want to know some uses for O-piece rotations, you may want to skip to Chapter 2.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will use some conventions throughout the guide to highlight important information, which will be written in
					colour-coded text:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="state">Yellow - states and state-dependent rotations</span></li>
                    <li><span class="nostate">Blue - state-agnostic rotations</span></li>
                    <li><span class="system">Pink - rotation system abbreviations</span></li>
                    <li><span class="credit">Green - credited people</span></li>
                </ul>

					<h3>Rotation</h3>
	
					<p>
						When you press a rotation button, your active piece will rotate by 90 degrees in the chosen direction.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Obvious statements aside, there's actually a lot more going on than most people give it credit for.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						A piece can be in one of four rotation states. In this guide, I will describe rotation states using
						"<span class="state">0R2L</span>" <span class="tooltip" title="Yes I did this on purpose you can't stop me">
						rotation notation</span>, in which pieces spawn in state <span class="state">0</span>, and rotating right
						(clockwise) changes to <span class="state">R</span>, <span class="state">2</span>, <span class="state">L</span>,
						then back to <span class="state">0</span>. Likewise, rotating left (<span class="tooltip"
						title="Despite my preference of 'anti-clockwise', CCW is the community-accepted abbreviation and it would just make things confusing">
						counter-clockwise</span>) from state <span class="state">0</span> will cycle through states <span class="state">L
						</span>, <span class="state">2</span>, <span class="state">R</span>, and <span class="state">0</span>.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						<strong>State-dependent</strong> rotations (i.e. those where the rotation state is relevant) will be written as
						combinations of the above rotation states, with an arrow to indicate direction. For example:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>
							A clockwise rotation from <span class="state">0</span> to <span class="state">R</span> is
							<span class="state">0R&gt;</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							A counter-clockwise rotation from <span class="state">0</span> to <span class="state">L</span> is
							<span class="state">&lt;0L</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							A clockwise 180-degree rotation from <span class="state">0</span> to <span class="state">2</span> is
							<span class="state">0R2&gt;</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							A single button 180-degree rotation from <span class="state">0</span> to <span class="state">2</span> is
							<span class="state">&lt;02&gt;</span>
						</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						You may be wondering how a <span class="state">0R2&gt;</span> rotation differs from a <span class="state">&lt;02&gt;
						</span> rotation. There's actually one game in this guide that implements 180-degree rotations like those featured
						in the Puyo Puyo series, where you can flip a piece by quickly double-tapping a rotation button in a tight space.
						Rotations like these technically work differently from 180-degree rotations triggered by a single button press,
						hence the different notation.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						<strong>State-agnostic</strong> rotations (i.e. those where the rotation state doesn't matter) will be written in
						one of two ways. The longer notation will be used for rotations on their own, while the shorter notation will be
						used for sequences.
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>Counter-Clockwise - <span class="nostate">CCW</span> or <span class="nostate">L</span></li>
						<li>Clockwise - <span class="nostate">CW</span> or <span class="nostate">R</span></li>
						<li>180 - <span class="nostate">180</span> or <span class="nostate">F</span></li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						In many stackers (especially modern Tetris games), the O-piece can have multiple rotation states even if each one
						is identical. This means the O-piece is actually rotating internally even if there is no visual feedback for doing
						so. In the Tetris Worlds implementation of the commonly used Super Rotation System, or <span class="system">SRS
						</span> for short, the O-piece internally rotates around one of its blocks (the lower-left block in state
						<span class="state">0</span>), but an offset is applied to keep it in place when rotated. This may or may not be
						the case for implementations in other games, though.

					<h3>Wall Kicks</h3>
	
					<p>
						<strong>Wall kicks</strong> are a feature of many modern rotation systems, allowing pieces to move when rotated if
						their new position is obstructed by a wall or another piece.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						In <span class="system">SRS</span>, four alternative positions are checked if basic rotation fails, and the piece
						will move to the first one that succeeds. For example, this is how the infamous Fin TSD works in
						<span class="system">SRS</span>:

					<p>
						Different rotation systems can handle wall kicks by defining a different offset table, or instead try to kick by
						rotating around an alternate centre. Regardless of implementation, they're super fun to use once you know how they
						work!

					<h3>Wiki Links</h3>
	
					<p>
						You may have noticed that I provide two very similar wiki links for many of the sections in this guide. Hard Drop
						and TetrisWiki are both fantastic community resources for information about Tetris games, but many of the pages
						have very similar content due to being forked from the now-defunct Tetrisconcept wiki, and editors (including me)
						adding content to both wikis at the same time.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Which one you pick is really down to personal preference, though if there's something you can't find on one wiki,
						you will probably be able to find it on the other.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Even though past proposals to merge the wikis have been rejected, the Tetris community generally agrees that both
						of them are <em>significantly</em> better than the Fandom wiki. Most of what I have seen on there seems to pre-date
						the wiki split, but there are still some pages on there that have useful information not on the other two wikis.
						I'd use it for those specific pages, but the others for everything else.

					<h3>"Versions of Tetris"?</h3>
	
					<p>
						So this section is that rant about semantics I mentioned earlier, which you'll hopefully find somewhat educational
						and/or entertaining. I'd love to know what other people think about this topic!
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Also, I hope this rant doesn't come across as too negative or angry. I'm not mad at any of you, I promise.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Am I the only one who is bothered by different Tetris games, and stackers in general, being referred to as
						"versions of Tetris"? It's a term which perpetuates the myth that the Tetris series is literally just the same game
						ported to pretty much every device imaginable, and that Tetris-like stackers are just knock-offs of what they
						perceive to be the "real thing".
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Sure, the original Tetris was the first stacker game. It did indeed start the genre of puzzle games which many
						people in the Tetris community name after it. But to say that they're all just the exact same game is plainly wrong.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						This isn't helped at all by the fact that even The Tetris Company, who licenses the Tetris series, refers to their
						own games as "versions" of the same game instead of what they are: entries in a series.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Don't get me started on the whole "it's just Tetris" thing.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						While all (tetromino-based) stacker games may superficially look identical to each other, they all feel very
						different to play at anything higher than a casual level. This is even true of modern Tetris games which have to
						adhere to the Tetris Guideline. Some examples of differences which drastically affect gameplay include:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Game modes</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Rotation systems</strong></li>
						<li>Piece randomisers</li>
						<li>Available drop types (soft, hard, sonic)</li>
						<li>Hold mechanics</li>
						<li>Spin recognition</li>
						<li>Lock delay (or lack of it)</li>
						<li>Timings (e.g. DAS and ARR)</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						To clear up some terms related to stacker games, this is how I use them in this guide:
					</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Stacker / Stacker Game</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A genre of puzzle games in which you place pieces (typically tetrominoes) and clear horizontal lines by
									completing them
								</li>
								<li>
									Includes the Tetris series and all Tetris-like stackers
								</li>
								<li>
									May use pieces other than tetrominoes or feature non-tetromino modes (outside the scope of this guide)
								</li>
								<li>
									Another name for this genre is "falling block puzzle"
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tetris Community</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The general community of people who love stacker games
								</li>
								<li>
									<em>Includes</em> stackers outside of the Tetris series
								</li>
								<li>
									The name is likely because the community often uses "Tetris" to refer to the entire genre
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tetris Series</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A series of stacker games licensed by The Tetris Company or its predecessors
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tetris Game</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
									An entry in the Tetris series
								</li>
								<li>
									<em>Does not include</em> games outside of the Tetris series
								</li>
								<li>
									Most are distinct from each other
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tetris-like Stacker</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A stacker game whose gameplay is largely based on Tetris, but is not a part of the Tetris series
								</li>
								<li>
									Being a "Tetris game" and being a "Tetris-like stacker" are mutually exclusive
								</li>
								<li>
									Known in the Tetris community as "unofficial games" or "fan games"
								</li>
								<li>
									Again, most are distinct from each other (and also from Tetris)
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Version</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A game ported to another platform with few or no changes
								</li>
								<li>
									Alternatively, a patched release of a game, indicated by a different version number
								</li>
								<li>
									The PS4 and Switch releases of Tetris Effect are versions of Tetris Effect, but Tetris Effect is not
									just a version of Tetris
								</li>
								<li>
									1.3.4 and 2.0.2 are also versions of Tetris Effect, regardless of platform
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						With that out of the way, let's get to the part where we rotate some O-pieces!
